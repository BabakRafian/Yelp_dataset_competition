The vibe is so cool with it being a guys place for sure! Thank you for a place that caters to the men we love. My husband has never had a better cut! Eric is a perfectionist and it shows with the precision and time he takes with each client and he is booked weeks in advance. If you have a beard this is definitely your spot!,1,0,0
e9UE531B4PfJndbai2CoTw,JYa6loCU2cnejrjjCKN3DA,R6dsQhkBRq2qwwPnqommKw,2,2017-06-15,I give it two stars because we stayed here two years in a row and the first time was wonderful but the second time was not. The second time was for my mom and aunts birthday who travelled 2500 miles and we rented a cabana at the main pool for the day (which isn't really cheap) and we decorated the cabana and ordered a beautiful cake (from a Phoenix bakery) and when I went to bring the cake in to the cabana I was stopped and told I could not bring in outside food (which I was told all week and knew from the ridiculous bag checks they do upon entering the pool area) because they want to make as much money as possible having people buy their food. Not even snacks for kids were allowed. I had to hide them deep inside the bag and wrap towel's around them to bring in snacks for my ONE year old. Anyways the rented cabana that we spent good money on and a week at their hotel which we also spent good money on and they wouldn't let us bring in a cake for a birthday into a cabana. I asked to speak to the manager and she was rude and wouldn't even hear me out. So frustrating. I had to walk back to the room and leave the cake there. For my family's yearly visit we will be going elsewhere.,1,0,0

We were looking for a nice and clean hotel close to downtown Montreal. Unfortunately, it wasn't any easy task. Most of the hotels are pricy... This hotel came across our search on trip advisor and had  mostly good reviews. We took our chances and were satisfied. It was close to Old Montreal and all the fun places. The room was a bit small but again clean. They also had breakfast ""in bed"": they would leave a basket with some muffins, yogurt and fruits for you by the door. I thought it was a great idea as I like to have my coffee and breakfast before I go out. Talking about coffee...the only problem we had is  broken coffee maker in the room...but they had coffee ready for you downstairs in the lunch room so it wasnt a big issue. 
All in all, great place for the money you pay, clean and friendly people.",0,0,0

I would definitely come back here just to go back to that suite bathroom. I mean, the service was great and dealing with the front desk was much better here compared to many other Vegas hotels... but the suite bathroom was pretty legit.

The suite was a fairly good size and had a separate living room, king size bedroom, one full bathroom + one half bathroom. The full bathroom was huge and included a standing shower, large isolated jacuzzi tub, long sink area, and a technologically advanced toilet (I was too scared to push those buttons..not sure what would have happened to me). 

Talking about technology, the whole suite was pretty much automated. There's a tablet that allows you to control the curtains\/sheers, temperature, lights, and maybe even the toilet (seriously I have no clue what that toilet is capable of). It was awesome to have the curtains set to open at 10am to wake up everyone after a long night of Vegas antics. It's a corner suite, so the whole room is pretty much covered in windows.

Would I come back and stay here again? Well, I did have really good luck at the blackjack tables here, so that's a plus. I don't think I'd stay at a regular room for the price, though. If I got another free corner suite? Ohhhh yeaaaaaa. Maybe I'll even pay for the suite too if I get it at a good rate. If I do, you can bet you'll find me lounging in the jacuzzi, champagne in one hand and that tablet in the other hand messing with the curtains (or maybe even the toilet - I really think it's possible ).",1,2,1

I signed her up with some basic swimming class and  I really think they have some great instructors like DJ, she learnt a lot within the 2 weeks, 8 sessions class. I continue to sign her up in another class, the current instructor is equally GREAT too.

After the class, she usually play in the baby pool and easier for parents to keep an eye on their kids. Unlike the Hamilton Aquatic Center which I also signed her up on weekend class, the instructor P doesn't seems to know how to teach...

For local Las Vegans, this is the spot to go for delicious sushi!  Locals drive from the North (about 30-40 minutes away) just to eat here.

Sushi is fresh and tasty. Get the Nuclear Bomb and the Heart Attack! Even the dessert is good. Get the creme brulee!

If you go for dinner, make sure to choose all you can eat, otherwise you'll be paying buckos! All You Eat menu is anything except sashimi. As of this writing, $26 for All you can eat dinner, $21 for lunch. It will be worth your money.

Waitstaff is casual and easygoing. They play EDM music in the background which keeps the atmosphere upbeat and fun. 

Only reason not a 5 star is because there usually is a wait. Everytime we've gone, we have had to wait 20-30 minutes for a table.

nEiIGV-mXRpWlxtpyJLy4g,Omhu17Pu7pGbO7KjbYLj1A,xYeLEIWbG0IBnMGU2mWUBg,1,2015-11-23,"just want to get this out of the way. i absolutely HATE korean bbq, but i'll try to be as unbiased about this as i can. I just don't like the idea of paying to cool my own food. paying $30 at that. the only reason i came was because it was a friends birthday.

how many people can even eat close to $30 worth of food at a kbbq place? it's so expensive. all you're doing at the end of the day, is throwing pre-marinated meat onto a grill. i'd really rather go spend my $30 at a nice restaurant and get a nice rare steak. often times, you're either over\/under cooking certain meats and sometimes burning them cus you forget while in conversation with your group.

the only things i actually enjoyed eating were the beef ribs and pineapple. speaking of pineapple, Brazilian steak house would be even better. WAY better.

however, obviously, people do for some reason like korean bbq. so there must be some sort of appeal to it, and if you like it, then maybe you'll like this. or if you haven't tried kbbq. maybe this is a not so bad place to try it.

verdict: i really don't know why people are willing to pay $30 to cook their own food.

I really hate to do this. because i always want to give places a chance. but this will have to be my first 1 star review. sorry.",2,4,0

My wife got a corned beef, it was as dry as the Sahara. Our fried zucchini app included several ""exploded"" ones that I wouldn't expect they'd serve.

Customer service has been good.  The first time I went in for a bridesmaid dress I didn't have an appointment but one of the consultants quickly made time for me to try on a few dresses.  When I was wedding dress shopping, the consultant assisting me, Jantelle (I think) was extremely helpful.  I had initially set an appointment at Alfred Angelo a couple months previous at a wedding show otherwise I probably never would have went dress shopping there.   Ultimately, I just didn't care for any dresses at AA, they just seem very mass produced and nothing special.

I guess I just expected to walk out of the salon looking like I'd had my hair cut.

In the days after my visit, I didn't receive one comment from friends or family about my hair. No one even noticed it had been cut. Despite asking for 1 1\/2 - 2 inches off, I felt like I didn't get any more than a 1\/2 inch off and I spent almost an hour in the chair.

Within 12 hours of posting the review, I was contacted by Shane, the District Manager of Goodyear in hopes of resolving the issue. This is the quickest response from management I've ever received after a discrepancy. I am blown away by how apologetic and accomadating Shane was. 

Prior to contacting me, he had pulled up my invoice and admitted that there was certainly a mistake that was made. He offered me a refund of the overcharged $100 and an explanation. 

This was simply a misunderstanding with a new staff member who was not informed of the promotions in place. From what I understand after the explanation from Shane, Goodyear does offer the ceramic pads at the promotion price. 

I don't exactly understand what the original sales employee had tried explaining to me at the time of payment about the different brake pads that are used, but Shane assured me that Goodyear stocks quality centric pads. 

This review update is simply on the urgency that was taken by upper management to resolve customer issues regardless of how large or small they might be. Goodyear is lucky to have an employee like Shane overlooking their locations.",13,7,9

Visiting Toronto for business, working about a 10min drive from here. 

Like the other guests, found the front desk staff to be polite, pleasant and easy to deal with. 
The room is clean and pretty decent in size, the bathroom again clean, with shower over bath.

Food wise - breakfast is included, as well as a light dinner on Mon-Thur. Nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done for a low fuss staying in meal. No room service, but a few take out menus in the room information folder. There is a small shop next to front desk with some basic staples and snacks.

There's tea and coffee available in the lobby area all the time, the coffee is actually pretty good for hotel filter coffee.

There's a free shuttle that runs half hourly to the airport - at 20 past and 10 to the hour. Unless you're right near the pick up time, in my opinion it's so close that a taxi ride would be money well spent to avoid prolonging your trip.

The area is pretty competitive - plenty of hotels to choose from. From this visit's experience, I would stay again.",1,0,0

Ordering is done on a pre-printed tablet like you find in sushi bars. You can pick from a variety of a la carte tacos, or you can build your own. They have about a half dozen sides to go with your tacos.

I ordered 3 tacos and 2 sides. I was stuffed, and I am not a small man. The servers were friendly  and engaging. The decor was Mexican Death (skeletons). The atmosphere was boisterous, and everyone was having a good time.

Located next to Tink Holl Marketplace, I thought this was a great idea to have a place to eat after you shop. The place isn't really up to par, such as the space itself. There are areas where they can utilize a little better such as the stage area. It's pretty much open with empty space of nothing. The tables are pretty much scattered and it was just dull. Not a wow for me. There were no music playing and just a weird feeling. It's like one of those places where the Asian mobs come together and rewind. 

However, the food on the other hand isn't that bad. We had their beef pan fried noodles, shrimp vegetables dish, and crab and fish maw soup. The soup tasted great and so did the noodles. The shrimp dish was kind of skimpy meaning they weren't really giving the right amount of shrimp. It's acceptable as far as the taste goes but would've been more better if they didn't cheated me with the shrimp.

He met us, charged $800 for the surgery (which still sucked of course but omg totally different price) and just was amazing. he had never met us before, we had never used this hospital before, he just did that for us as first time customers because he truly cares for animals.

The fact is that I have 5 children and have had many birthday parties at several other kid venues around the valley and yours was lacking to say the least. So please allow me to clarify your confusion. 

1. You called to confirm our reservation, and yet when we arrived, at 3:10p, there was no party set up and all the tables were dirty. 
So what exactly did my $50 groupon pay for? The three balloons and use of your nasty tables? ANY other venue would have a table set up and ready for our arrival.
2. I paid an additional $50 for 1 pepperoni pizza, 4 pitchers of soda, and 1 small gluten free pizza for 6 kids....I've paid far less, for much more.
3.I then paid an additional $50 for admission and use of your facility which we found to be subpar. The floors and over all cleanliness of your facility was poor.... And the bathrooms were gross. 
4. I didn't mention this in my review about the fact that your staff allowed such rough behavior by other patrons, to include the fact that my daughter was choked on the slide and another of our guest was pushed and bullied to the point that we had to intervene to prevent this 2 year old from being injured was Unsatisfactory indeed.
In closing I paid $150 for no decorations, over priced food and a small & subpar facility with poor customer service. 
I understand that you must deal with unhappy customers on a regular basis, and normally I would say nothing, but it is wrong to post a groupon in order to scam people out of their hard earned money. And it is my duty as a parent and fellow grouponer to make sure that anyone considering to purchase that groupon, be aware that the Play Factory is a complete rip off!

The good:
- Appetizers, specifically the polenta and the olive dish are great
- The decor
- The fact that it's a nice change on Gerrard

The bad:
- Really poorly run service, we witnessed so many people walking in and waiting for an unacceptably long period of time to be seated, food took far too long to come to the table, we had empty cups for the entire dinner service and we witnessed several people get up to find staff to settle their bill 
- Deep fried pizza is far too salty and oily! Someone else commented on the fact that it feels like the oil has just been sitting on the pizza for a while and I sadly have to agree
- Bringing your child to work when you clearly don't know how to handle a busy restaurant, I'm hoping this was an emergency and that's why they had their crying daughter at work but until they can serve customers in a timely fashion I would say it's a bad idea to bring your kid to work - you have enough on your plate, why make this more difficult for yourself.

So this time we purchased it again from Paris Le Village buffet and it was $74.99 per person due to holiday weekend (July 4th) which I think was reasonable. Upon purchasing it, I checked with the staff about the additional fee I needed to pay if I chose to go to Bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace. The cashier lady at Paris buffet told us that it was $20. We found the price to be reasonable so we purchased three passes and decided to go to Bacchanal Buffet during these 24 hours. 
After many many experience with Vegas and misinformation from hotel staff, I went ahead to check with other hotel staff at concierge and its Caesars website about the additional fee to Bacchanal buffet. Some told us $20 additional fee, website said $30, so we prepared ourselves to be charged about $20-$35. 
It was a very hot sunny day at 104F outside, we walked from Planet Hollywood to Caesars with my mom, my hubby and my two years old baby. Since my mom was platinum member, we went to the fast VIP lane and ready to pay and stuff ourselves with food. We showed the cashier lady that we had BOB and we understand that there's extra fee. But we never expected the amount the lady said. It was $44.99 extra!!! Are you kidding me??? Even your website said $30 and there's no mention anywhere in your website that said there's going to be even higher price during holiday! (Which we have already paid $74.99 holiday price per BOB pass!)
We argued with the lady that everyone from total rewards told us it's either $20, $35, and website said $30. She called the manager on duty to come over and he told us that it's $44.99 and its either you pay or go elsewhere. He told us we can go to other buffet within the BOB. I was really pissed off as I even showed him the website from Caesars and he still didn't want to honor the price! Such a bad management and so many misinformation around. They should train their staff to provide correct information to customer because basically, they were lying to us when we first purchased the BOB from Paris, the $20 additional fee was one of the factors why we would buy the pass!! If they told us it was $44.99 per head, we probably wouldn't buy it.
Anyway, since there's no point standing in line occupying the line, so we stepped aside. I immediately called the customer service line that was provided by Caesars palace website especially indicating to call when we have any question about the holiday price. I told the CS that it was July 4th weekend and I have paid $74.99 for the pass, how much would I need to pay extra if I want to go to the Bacchanal buffet. The CS said it was $35 extra fee!! So I went back to talk to the lady cashier and I put the phone on speaker. I asked the CS the same question, she said $35! And the lady cashier immediately grabbed the phone and told the CS that it was $44.99. Haha
So after we put down the phone, the lady cashier immediately informed the manager and at the end, they honored the price of $35.
The point is not about the money. The point is about providing the correct information to the customer and train your staff!! And if the website didn't even say abt $44.99, why are you charging people extra! It's like they could just name their own price, whatever they want, which is wrong! 
Bacchanal buffet is not worth going anymore. They charge ridiculous amount during holiday to rip people off. The oysters had sands in it and customer service was just meh. They didn't even refill us our drinks the entire stay. The prime rib was just so so. I think the best in the buck buffet is planet Hollywood spice market. 
So the moral of the story- do not trust any of the staff said. Stand to your ground when things happen. Justice will serve!",2,0,0

I saw some shirts that were kohls brand that were faded and definitely worn 20+ times with a price tag of $6.29 on them. I could go to kohls with a coupon on the clearance rack and get them brand new for not too much more. It truly is a shame that they upped their prices especially since all of the donations are FREE. They make a 100% profit on everything there. The CEO of this company probably got a pay raise- like I said, this truly is a shame to see this.

The off-leash dog park is just past the Grenadier cafe, where there is a brief two-way traffic zone.  You can park along the right,  and release the hounds as soon as you pass through the gate.  

After they get the sniff out of their system we take to the wooded trails which according to Kafrey and Six, all seem to lead down to the creek and the paved road (Spring road I think).   The off-leash areas are clearly marked and you will encounter signs telling you if you are entering or leaving an off-leash area.  Inevitably, there is the odd dog-less person who wandered along, didn't see the sign and is confused at to why he is getting his crotch sniffed by a pack of dogs.

The dog-park part has a nice sandy surface, plenty of picnic tables for humans and a water tap that the city turns on in May.  There are a couple porta-potties if you take the trail towards the allotment gardens, and lots of waste-bins for the dog-bags.

The menu selection was a bit disappointing. There are 5 Sushi\/rolls dishes to choose from (as appetizers). 8 small plates choices and 7 large plate choices.
We started with the $9 Spicy BBQ Ribs from the small plate. It came with 4 ribs and some kimchi. It was delicious.
I picked the Udon noodles with spicy steak ($19) and my guy picked the Massaman Curry Chicken(19).  My Udon noodles was just maybe 1 min over cooked, the beef was not spicy and a little bit tough. The soup overall  was a bit flavor less and too salty especially when I got to the end. My guy said that the Curry chicken was good but he's definitely had a better $12 curry at a lot of other places with bigger portions. The chicken chunk was too large and a bit burnt. The curry flavor was a bit plain, almost missing something. 

The serves was attentive and the food came out quickly. Our bill came out to be $51 total. A bit much for the quality I would say!",1,0,0

Of you might call it is an ethnic restaurant, which is what I would say.  As an ethnic restaurant you forgive the ""basic"" ambiance and applaud the friendly service and cleanliness.  The food, however, is spotty and the menu choices limited.

The best buy were the empanadas at $1 each (most of us would call them croquettes).  A crisp tasty corn meal outside was stuffed, supposedly with beef, but actually with potatoes with a few morsels of meat.  The one dipping sauce available was spicy but not tasty.  

The roasted chicken had a great rub but the breast was so overcooked that it was not only dry but hard to cut.  No sauces of any kind to alleviate the problem.  The arepa is a corn pancake, in our case stuffed with cheese, tasty but also dry.

The platano maduro was the best dish, but at five bite size pieces for $3.50, it was overpriced.  Give us a bit more please.

Then I saw the salad bar.  ICEBERG LETTUCE.  That set the stage for how the whole rest of the meal went, honestly.  

I had been looking forward to the sald bar anyways so I still got it as one of my sides for my dinner entree.  The potato salad and broccoli salad were very good.  My sister had to dig at the bottom for the dredges of the broccoli salad as they did not fill it after numerous people had their portion, however.  The rest of the salad bar was just ok.  Nothing spectacular, and again, iceberg lettuce was the only option.  Not that great for what they charge for it.  

My sister and aunt chose the soup and salad option as their meal, and after they had finished their salads and were waiting patiently for the soup to come out, the waitress informed them that they were evidently out of the chicken noodle soup they ordered and she wasn't aware until she was just about to serve it.  My aunt substituted the vegetable soup and said it was lacking something, she didn't finish it but the waitress kindly said she'd take it off the bill since she didn't enjoy\/finish it.  My sister just went back to dig up what was left from the salad bar.

I got the sampler platter as my dinner with a side of the homemade macaroni and cheese.  The macaroni and cheese was good, but I think it was lacking a little something as well.  All our food was served lukewarm.  The chicken was the best part, moist and delicious.  The ham was served wtih a pineapple glaze, and tasted pretty standard.  The roast beef was not very good and I barely ate any of it.  Not BAD but just no good flavor.  

The pie was delicous, I enjoyed the peanut butter chocolate cream pie and yummy crust.  But that was the best part of all of our meals.

Yeah, you're going to get the beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, that is just a given. And yes it is the perfect setting to throw down a martini or six. What I love most about this bar are the bartenders, well the martini's then the bartenders. I guess the martinis are made by the bartenders so them first? Chicken and the egg thing I guess. Autumn and Aaron have been bartending at the Wright Bar for years now and they don't get much better than these two. When you're able to text your bartender the next day to find out whether you paid or how many martinis you had, you know you're in good hands. The Wright Bar has a great set-up where you can sit inside when it's cold or you can sit inside when it's hot as hell! Okay, it does have an amazing patio, but I feel like it's too far away from the vodka. The Wright Bar is my go to when I'm feeling like a nice martini and light conversation. Sit back, relax and enjoy the beauty of the Biltmore, it doesn't get much better than this!

The risotta cake was just okay and seemed to me like average leftover risotta balled together and fried.

Locals like me can get a card that knocks off another $3 on top of that (so I've been told)! The staff is friendly and attentive. This place can get crowded, and some of these drinks take a minute to make, so bear with them if it's busy. They will definitely get around to your order. 

If the parking out front is packed, park behind and use the back door, which is how the Rat Pack would've done it! You will love this bar for sure. It's going to hold a special place in Vegas history, so be a part of it... Cheers!",2,1,2

VRHB1Kmf7sj0hNUJDi5PTA,wzyGNvArcpUjZauRWFrKHA,u-67zd1ImTv3EEr5kIdWrA,2,2014-09-25,"I stayed at the Mandalay Bay for a conference and we had a private event here one evening.

The food was pretty good.  Sliders were tasty (pulled pork and meatball were the best...angus was just ""meh""), the shrimp and grits were delicious, as was the jambalaya. 

Bartenders were great, drinks were good and the music selection had everyone dancing.  The place has a cool look and vibe.

So why only two stars?  This HOB suffers from the same issue as the one in Chicago.  The music is deafening!  I was standing beside someone trying to have a conversation (after all, this was a social event in connection with a conference) and as we were shouting at each other to be heard, they actually turned the music up!  We just looked at each other and laughed because even though we were three inches from each other, there's no way we could continue the conversation.

Thankfully, one of the big cheeses from the conference was able to get them to turn it down a notch about 10 minutes later but by the time I left, my ears were ringing and my voice was hoarse from shouting.  

If there's a live band, I guess that's one thing but just cranking it up so loud that everyone has to stand there with no interaction because it's physically too loud to converse, that's not terribly fun in my book.  I guess this must be a corporate decision since the loud music seems to be consistent but I don't think I'd choose to go to another HOB in the future because I actually like to interact with the people I go out with.  Except maybe in Houston, because that location was okay.

Side note: If you search for the word ""loud"" in the reviews, you get 26 hits.  Most of them complain about it being too loud.",2,0,0

Kind of trendy, very bar-oriented ( I'm not much of a drinker).  But, I was curious, so I decided to check it out.  First of all, my server was really nice and attentive.  He recommended the Chicken en rojo.  First, he brought out a small but fresh chopped salad with a variety of lettuces and a little tomato.  Nothing special, but the dressing, which I had on the side, was wonderful.  It was a tamarind vinaigrette.  I highly recommend it if you like sweet spicy dressings.  Next, the entree came.  It was a pounded chicken breast, topped with cream cheese sauce, roasted fingerling potatoes, and surrounded by a delicious red pepper cream sauce.  It was phenomenal.  I would definitely go back just for this dish.  I wasn't crazy about the chips and salsa, but I liked everything else.",4,0,3

Nope, it ain't fancy, but the service is fast and friendly. The food is delicious! 

I've been many times now, and have never been disappointed. From Pad Thai, to several different curries, Beautifully flavored Tom Kah soup, and Thai Spicy Basil - it's all good. 

My only criticism is that the fried tofu always seems a bit watery and kinda bland. It would be much better if they pressed some water out of it before frying. Still. Not bad.

The biggest surprise was when I asked for sticky rice with mango -and was disappointed to find that it was out of season. The server suggested instead the black sticky rice with shredded coconut.

I was leery. Black sticky rice?? No mango?
It was fantastic!!! I may just order it as my meal next time.

DO NOT under any circumstances consider joining this club. I detailed the shoddy state of the facility in my previous review, and finally could not stand working out there any longer. I went in to the club to cancel my membership long before the month I had already paid for (can't do it online or anything, natch!), and Life Time is now attempting to bill me for *another* month.

A gym membership is not like renting an apartment -- there is no need to give a month's notice so they have time to somehow fill the slot that I am vacating. This is an absolutely ridiculous concept, and is nothing short of a fraudulent attempt to pocket additional revenue.

This nonsense is absolutely astounding. I cannot believe that customers have allowed a company this large to get away with this, and I suspect that many people would think twice about joining if they knew this was the policy. My unequivocal advice is: don't think twice; don't even consider patronizing this disgusting, deceitful business.",11,5,3

First of all, we came on a nice summer evening so we sat outside. Real chill and comfortable. Not sure how the indoors seating works, it looks like it's part of ""le Cinq""? 
Service was relaxed, but they seem to come at the wrong times. We got asked if everything is okay by a different server every single time, so that was a bit amusing. When we wanted to get the bill (we had a movie to catch), the people seemed to appear a lot less frequently. 

We started with the duck confit blueberry nem rolls. Basically two spring rolls filled with duck, with a blueberry sauce on the bottom. They were really one dimensional, I thought the duck confit would be amazing but it turned out kind of bland. The sauce wasn't very complimentary either, it was a bit bitter, I was hoping for a tart and sweet flavour to boost the dish. 2 rolls for $12. hm

Next, we got small size poutines in mao zhe dong and fidel. 
Both poutines has great flavours, but for the price we're paying, I do hope there were more toppings!
The Fidel was supposed to have shrimp and scallops, but everytime we thought we found a piece...it was just a cheese curd. I think in total there were 4 tiny pieces. The flavour was delcious though. The lobster bisque that stands in for the gravy was a good choice. 
The mao zhe dong have barbeque pork, and foie gras. Also the same complaint here, too little toppings! We got 3 extremely thin slices of pork :( Then again, the foie gras infused sauce was delicious.

Anyways, the poutines were very filling because of all the fries (we could only finish half of it). Since the restaurant feels more high end than regular poutine joints, they should focus on the toppings that really make the dishes stand out. Keep doing what you're doing with the sauces though!",1,0,0

It was a busy night, so I was very lucky to get in, and get a seat at the bar. The staff was very attentive. Although, they did forget my potstickers, but I won't hold that against them. Every roll I had was made right in front of me, which I had never experienced before.

I cannot believe the price of the drinks in this place and what infuriated me the most was that they charged the gratuity automatically and then handed us our ticket in the dark and without saying anything about it let me then tip on top of that total. I think that is beyond rude. I would have left a decent tip any way because the service was fine. Just upsets me. I also think your two drink minimum is rude when you charge $8 for a soda. I had never been to a comedy club before and was really excited to go and the comedians were pretty funny but I wont be back. Over $300 after some drinks and a double tip. No thanks.,0,0,0
qhy_reLORMm6tQfhPZkp4A,xdW2zehpCYsdXCLnbYABeg,fs_-JDwKyVIc6iCXnpUzgw,1,2015-06-29,"This was hands down the worst buffet that i've ever been to. First off when you pull in there is a big hole that is near impossible to avoid so turn in slowly. From the outside this place looks busted. It wouldn't be a place that you would just stop in and check out driving past it. We walked in and were seated by the hostess who also took our drink orders. From there our waitress picked up our ticket and brought our drink orders to the table, never, from the entire meal, saying a single word to us. So we took it upon ourselves to wonder over to the buffet. I struggled choosing what to add to my plate. Everything looked old, greasy & soggy. I was excited when I found the fried rice. That was the one thing that looked normal. From the buffet I tried the Shrimp (w\/ Head), Beef w\/ Broccoli, Some Sort of Beef Roll, Sesame Chicken, a Spring Roll, Stuffed Shrimp, Fried Chicken Wings and the Beef Roast. Not a single thing tasted good. One bite of each and I was done. And the Stuffed Shrimp, when you look under the bottom, looks so disgusting and oily, didn't even try that one. I was just so turned off by this place. The chicken wing was the only thing that I got that I felt was edible. 

So I then decided to wonder to the front to try the Hibachi Grill. I figured I should atleast be able to eat that since they're cooking it fresh. You grab a plate and start adding the Starch, Veggies & Protein that you want them to cook. They had Rice & Noodles as your starches. I went for the rice first, but trying to scoop it up it was in large clumps and was hard. So I decided to go for noodles instead though I typically don't eat the noodles. The veggies did look fresh so I added a bunch of those. But the proteins weren't labeled. I didn't know which was pork, beef, chicken, etc. The only thing that look familiar was the Shrimp so I grabbed a big scoop of that and kind of took a wild guess at the steak, which I ended up being right about. I handed him my plate, he didn't say a word to me, and he proceeded to cook my food. I decided to head to my table while I wait to avoid awkwardly standing there. Who wants to be that girl just hanging out at the buffet? lol! Plus I figured it'd take a while for my steak to be done. So after a few minutes I head back to check on my food. My plate was sitting out front the grill with customers leaning on it.  *sigh*. Skeptically I take my food back to my table & still decide to try it. It tasted literally like nothing. No sauce, no seasoning, just nothing. My steak was raw. I figured since it's hibachi they would cut it up. But no, just a big lump of steak place on top my food. The steak was so chewy & tough I couldn't even finish my 1st bite. Later as we walked past the Hibachi again, we noticed that you could pick different sauces and tell the cook what you'd like. Why wouldn't he ask me when I gave him my plate?? So yeah, I was over the hibachi. I ended up just going back to get a plate of Fried Rice & a few Chicken Wings. That ended up filling me up.

We also noticed while we dined that they had a sign on the Napkin Dispenser telling you not to waste food and if you did there would be a penalty. Really??? This is a buffet. Of course there is going to be wasted food. We took our bill to the front to pay and dared them to charge us a fee but they did not. My bill with the buffet and a drink came to around $10. Save your money, this place wasn't even worth that.",10,4,3

Service was slow.
At one point a server broke a glass in the doorway to the room picked up the big pieces and left the little shards there the entirety of our 2.5 hour service.
After waiting an hour and fifteen minutes our meals finally arrived. NOT WORTH THE WAIT. Every single plate had food that was warm at best some of it actually cold. The $4 mash that came with my steak besides being an incredibly small portion for box quality potatoes was beginning to harden on he outside from sitting around so long. One of our friends was able to pick up the entire side of mash in one piece and flip it over without it shifting in shape at all. 
I ordered the ribeye which is $37 it like everything served was cold I quit on eating it after one bite. I have legitimately had better $10 steaks at cheap bars. None of our 11 friends were happy with the food, four of us myself included immediately returned it, my first time sending food back at a restaurant, we opted to not have it remade as we did not want to be left waiting for another hour for food. The manager came of right away as the server knew while serving us that it was far below quality food. He took the food back after trying to argue for the food quitting when my one friend showed him the steak juice was literally dried to the plate. He took off the food that was not eaten and gave us all 25% off (not enough if you ask me) and never truly apologized and didn't really seem apologetic.

They've remodeled quite a bit and are in the process of remodeling the rooms.

The rooms have an updated look... but with all the money they still have smallish TV's (40""?)  Service from everyone was great... front desk, maid, concierge, etc.

Only gripes are the little details in the room were overlooked... loose faucet handles, disgusting bath mat, moldy looking grout between bath tiles... these really kept me from giving it 4 or 5 stars.  I appreciate the remodel and the overall look, but the little things bring it down!

The restaurants in the hotel were pretty good. Buffet was not the best but a great price, BLT burger was great, CPK was pricy but delicious, overall can't complain.

There were plenty of tables to gamble at throughout the day... with mostly $10 blackjack and as low as $5 for some of the gimmicky games like 3 card poker or let it ride.  Cocktail waitresses were super friendly but a bit slow on the drink orders.

He wasn't rude but asked they come back the next day between 9:30 and 10:30am.  They showed up well before 10:30.  The male owner walked inside their house and the female owner came out.

She said they could come back in 4-5 days if they want to see anything or just not come back at all. She accused them of missing an appointment when they never made an appointment and came specifically when they were told to by the husband who wouldn't let them in the day before.

They serve fried chicken, waffles and grits... sinful, comfort food.  The reviews on yelp said the place is tiny, a bit slow (as they cook to order) and terribly busy on weekends.  For my visit, I came on a Tuesday at 11:15, right before a normal lunch rush. 

When I walked in, I was relieved to see there were a few empty tables.  Yelpers weren't kidding. This place had 9 or 10 tables, and no where to really stand if you were waiting for food or a table.  There were a few tables outside, and fortunately it wasn't hot that day.

The staff greeted us, and handed us a menu.  I narrowed my choice to the Kentucky: wings + 2 sides, which I chose grits and yams.  An order of grits came with 1 topping, so I chose bacon... truly not a healthy meal, is it?

Stephen chose the Louisiana Hot Link sausage, eggs, and grits with bacon AND cheese (0.75 more for an extra topping).  He chose cornbread while I chose a biscuit.

The food took about 20 minutes, and while we waited, we were served our drinks. Sweet tea for me, diet coke for Stephen.  She even stopped to give us refills.  Top notch service.

The meal was delicious, and not overly greasy.  It didn't look like a lot of food, but it took a while for me to finish it... and I was truly full all day. Even when we had a late dinner at 9:30, I wasn't really that hungry.  I'll be back for more, but will visit only if it's mid-week.

It's exactly what you'd expect.

Yesterday, I had 3 curries, all of which were warm, but not *hot* in terms of spice.  They were creamy -- and a tiny bit heavy for my tastes, but very edible.  The menu is a mix of northern and southern indian, and is in larger portions than I've had around CLE.  You can get idli, dosa, roti, and paratha here... as well as many other fan favourites (yes, from many regions; thanks Vasanth!)

Given that I live right next to Saffron Patch (Will review tomorrow!), I think I'd rather go there, despite being a tad more expensive.  Yet, if one is in Parma, this is definitely a good place to go.

The club is a few doors down from REI in the corner of a strip mall, plenty of parking and w\/easy freeway access.  

The main entrance to the club is through a small smoking patio ringed by misters with a half dozen high tables, roll out bar, and on this particular night, an ice block ""luge"" for taking shots.   Off to the side there's a hole in the wall pizza place that you can enter without having to leave the patio. 

I love being outside on the patio during the warm desert summer nights, so having the patio is a plus for me.  It's also an opportunity to give your ears a break from high volume levels when the band is playing.   The water pump for the misters should probably be moved up on the roof and out of earshot however.  Listening to that thing hammer away all night takes away from some of the ambience. 

Inside the club I remember it being exceedingly *dark*, which suits me just fine.  From what I could make out in the blackness, the decor was spartan, understated, and more or less contemporary.  The men's room smelled bad, but it wasn't a disaster.  There was no lock on the door though, god forbid you had to drop an ""emergency deuce"" cause you'd be putting on a show for all the bystanders outside.  Overall, the place is pretty nice and not your typical shithole music dive.

There is a full bar and a decent selection of beers on tap, but the major downside here is that draft beers are served in clear plastic cups.   So my first drink of the night, a Kiltlifter draft, got warm prematurely.  After that I switched to a shot of Hornitos Sauza to sip while knocking back a salvo of Pacificos for the rest of the night.  I didn't have any mixed drinks so I can't comment on how the pour is.  Beers were $4 IIRC, wells approx $5.   Door cover is usually ~$5-10 weekend nights, $15 for out of town acts, no cover weeknights.  

The sound was good, and pretty f'ing loud if you ask me.  Bring earplugs if you don't want to sustain temporary hearing damage and a bout of tinnitis the next morning.  

So far as the crowd goes, it was a good mix, easily more than half female, undoubtedly due in part to the good looks of lead singer Shelby James.   I'd say it was mostly late 20s-30s.  Everybody we talked to was cool, no attitudes, creepiness or aggression from what I could tell, aside from a brief spat of drama with a couple of girls out on patio later in the night. The staff was friendly, good humored, and attractive.

All in all a nice night out.",2,2,2

Upon taking it back to the scam artist they tell me my fly wheel is damaged(which I already knew). They tell me to fix it they would have to pull out my transmission to replace the fly wheel, but my fly wheel was never damaged because if it was they would have told me that the first time they fix my starter. I explained to them they did not shimmy the wheel down properly and damaged it why should I pay for something he was reliable for doing. My fly wheel was either not damaged and they damaged it or was damaged and didn't tell me knowing it would damage my starter again and this time costing me more money to fix because they would have to remove the transmission.

With so many Thai restaurants in town, I keep trying a few a week and still never get close to finishing the list.  This one in particular was very interesting to try as the ratings were very good, but the area of town not so bright.  China Town is one thing, but the location of Thai St. Cafe on Industrial Rd. is a little off-putting.  The restaurant's inside is very nice but I wouldn't hang out outside.

I tried the eggplant and tofu and opted for 10 on the spicy level (top).  The level of spiciness wasn't over the top, burn your mouth, but it did make you sweat a little. The dishes I ordered seemed pretty similar though, as if they were all made in the same pot, with different veggies and sauces and meats added right before serving.  The taste and sauce were not mouth watering but still above average.

Not sure I will be back any time soon, but the prices are very affordable and portion sizes accommodating.  If in the area for lunch I would not turn down Thai St., but I will continue searching for the best Thai.",0,0,0

A wee place tucked in between Foodies and Tescos near Holyrood Park, it serves up packed wraps and salads at amazingly lower prices - and after only one salad, I know I'll be back.

It was the Weeping Tiger wrap that I came here for, but my evening meal plans scuppered that. I'm going out for a bucket of meat* later that night, so a wrap packed full of pulled pork did not sound sensible. I opted, instead, for the Roasted Veg Salad with Pesto. It was a nice wee box of fresh salad and quite a few bits of roasted aubergine, pepper and onion in a delicious pesto dressing.

The Weeping Tiger wrap is where it's at though. Joe A kindly let me have a bite, and good LORD. It was almost the same price as the salad (£2.95 vs £3.50) but lawdy lawdy. That was some amazing, tender pulled pork and the sauce it came in - sweet, spicy. It's only on Tuesdays and Fridays, and apparently they fly out the door. I love it when a place that does simple things (sandwich, salad and lunch options) becomes famous for one thing - and I can see The Weeping Tiger wrap becoming Let Me Eat's signature dish.

I will come back on a night when I'm not eating a bucket of meat in order to have the Weeping Tiger wrap - and soon! 4 stars from what I tasted, the friendly staff, and how efficient and quick they were even on a sunny, Friday afternoon rush-hour.

The prices range depending on quality, decade, etc, from very affordable to serious splurge but there is definitely plenty of affordable fair priced items to pick from.

Let me tell you - incase you don't know from my reviews. I love fine dining and gastronomy in general... I hate to work out, I hate athletics and I hate sweating, sneakers, etc... If you look up ""indoor girl"" in the dictionary = my photo!  

BUT I actually look forward to going to the gym now. I miss it if I don't go. The work outs are different every single day and the circuit moves quickly, so you never get bored and there are people of every size and shape at every fitness level, so you never feel out of place.

They do a 6 week challenge that you can be part of and if you lose 20lbs in 6 weeks, it's free - you get your money back. If you follow the plan and do the work outs, you'll lose the weight.

But you can just come to the gym for work outs too, you don't have to do the challenge. It's located in Area 51 which I'd been to before for acting or screenwriting meetups - there is always parking on the street or in the lot and it's pretty easy to get to from any part of town.

They offer work outs at many times too - I go to the 6pm, but they have a 7pm too and also morning ones.. i think 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9am - I am not a morning person, but good for you if you are. :)

Sylvester (the trainer at 6pm and 7pm) is very good, he pushes you but he also shows you the different ways to do the exercises if you can't do the most difficult version - so you never feel like you are left out or frustrated.

I recommend this gym for anyone who wants to learn to love working out or who is bored with just getting on the treadmill and watching tv while you run or walk...",2,0,0

About a year ago she had a filling fall out and I couldn't convince her to go to a dentist, despite constant pain. She didn't have insurance at the time so she thought it was rational to wait (NOPE. if you are reading this now, do NOT do what she did). She also has a terrible fear of dentists, which might be a factor...previously she said she only had a ""sadistic"" dentist.

So she scheduled an appointment with Affordable Dental after my constant prodding and nagging, and now she's on the road to recovery and feeling much better. She had a series of complicated procedures - there was an infection (understandable after a year) which made the procedure really hard, at one point during a procedure she just wasn't clotting right and they had to patch her up and try again tomorrow. She also had to be on antibiotics for a while to fight off the infection.

Throughout all of this, the staff of Affordable Dental were incredibly kind...they didn't shame her for coming in so late, and set up a payment plan with her to make it more feasible. The doctor himself is incredibly gentle and tries to make things as painless as possible (even though, in her case, pain was pretty much unavoidable after waiting a year to fix it).

Basically I would recommend this practice for ANYTHING. When I need my next cleaning, I'll be heading to Affordable Dental (and you should too).",3,2,1

As you'd expect with pretty much any upscale restaurant in a large Vegas hotel, the decor is over the top and the prices match. The food, while beautiful, didn't have the flavor to match its appearance.

The complimentary bread basket they brought us looked great and included garlic jalapeño bread, corn muffin (made with swirled blue and yellow cornmeal), and walnut raisin bread. The muffins were dry and pretty bland. The two breads were tasty, though.

What had sold me on coming here was the dish that Flay is supposedly known for--the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale. The shrimp and tamale were quite delicious, but the creamy sauce covering the whole dish was way salty and totally killed it for us.

The smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla was pretty dang smoky, which is not my jam (that was my own fault, though--it's right there in the name).

The cornmeal crusted chile relleno was beautiful, and had great crunch with the cornmeal coating, but some of the eggplant was undercooked and the flavors weren't really doing it for me.

The far and away highlight of the evening was the cauliflower gratin with roasted poblano. ORDER THIS! Super creamy and cheesy, with a really nice crisped top, loads of flavor, cooked to perfection. This dish is a contender for best thing I ate this Vegas trip. So good!

The service was good.

My husband would like to take this opportunity to register his complaint about the men's restroom: the urinals were ridiculously close together with no divider. ""If you weren't careful, you could run into each other!"" So, there's that.",6,4,4

But the best part of show, supirisingly, was not the hot dancers, but the black comedian Sean E. Cooper. He made the show to a different level because he's funny as hell! He might be one of the funniest person I've ever met.

I haven't had shaved ice like this before. It's kind of like if ice cream and shaved ice had a cool little baby: creamy, but very light, and not one ice chunk. It's only mildly sweet, which is really refreshing, and also not overwhelming if you add sweet toppings. We shared the following: 

Black sesame snow with red beans, mochi, and snowflake sauce: If you haven't experienced sesame as a flavor on it's own, I'd liken it to peanut butter, but with a slight bitter note. It's delicious, and since this is black sesame it gives your snow a grey hue, which, let's face it, is pretty excellent for your Instagram photos. I didn't love the mochi, but I'm only a fan of ice cream mochi, and don't usually love it when it's featured as a topping in this manner, so I think that's just me. The red beans were good, as was the snowflake sauce (fancy name for sweetened condensed milk).

Cantaloupe snow with strawberries, chocolate chips, strawberry, and chocolate sauces: This cantaloupe snow was so dreamy. Yum yum YUM! Granted, I love cantaloupe, but it really tasted like if you'd turned cantaloupe into frozen cream. It wasn't too sweet, and there was no fake flavor. Of course, the strawberry (this was just the fruit, no extra sugar) was a fitting and delicious addition, but the chocolate meshed surprisingly well with the other flavors. I liked both the sauces, and honestly could have even added the snowflake sauce too. I would second what another reviewer stated and suggest they have bottles of the sauces available to customers so you can add more if desired. About halfway through I wished I had more, and if they are free anyways, why not?

You have the option of three sizes, and we opted for small on both orders. It was plenty! You can only have two flavors of snow if you get the large (lame). The small is $3.93, and the cost of each additional topping is $0.50. They have bottled water for only $0.25.

The shop is small, with seating for maybe twelve people. Luckily, we were there around 2:00pm on a weekday so it wasn't too busy (although parking in the shopping center was atrocious). There were at least a few other customers either eating or ordering the entire time we were there. The two employees working were pretty quick to make our orders, but if it were busy I could see a wait of five or ten minutes.

I brought in an opal that we picked up in Australia, and created a design for a bracelet that I wanted to have made for my Grandmother.  I brought it to this shop and Ed agreed they could make the design happen, no problem.  When I went to pick it up, the gold was full of nicks and the solder marks were bubbly around the opal.  I asked them to fix this and was given a ""well, it's a handmade piece, so we can't do much about that"".  Fine.  I still liked that they were able to make my design a reality.  However, I also noticed a line\/crack across the bracelet, which I brought to Ed's attention.  He explained this was a solder line. I specifically asked if that was going to create a weak spot (it was a cuff bracelet, so there would be some moving of the metal putting the bracelet on and taking it off).  I was assured that would not be a weak spot and sent on my way.   I also noticed and inquired about the bezel that the opal was set in, because it looked uneven.  Again, I was given the ""handmade"" excuse, they can't do anything about it.  

Of course, the first time my Grandmother put the bracelet on, it cracked in two pieces.. exactly where the solder line was that I specifically said asked if it would be a weak spot.  So I returned to the shop, mortified that the VERY EXPENSIVE piece of jewelry I had given to my Grandmother as a birthday gift had already broken.  Ed apologized and assured it would be fixed.  Two weeks went by.  No call from the jewelry shop.  Finally, I called them to inquire and was told it had been ready, but they forgot to call me.  I went to pick it up, and he handed me the box.  The bracelet was filthy, but I found no more solder lines, and Ed said he remade that side of the bracelet.  Fine.

So I shipped the bracelet back to my Grandmother using insured (expensive) service.  Not more than a week after she had it, the opal fell out.  So she had to take it to her own jeweler to have the opal re-set and she had to pay for it.

I am so upset, I cannot even explain.  This was supposed to be something beautiful for my very elderly Grandmother who is so dear, and all it's been is a HUGE and VERY EXPENSIVE disaster.

Can't believe I gave this place 4 stars before.. dropping it to 3 now, but it's more like 2.5

Service was slow and terrible even though the place was practically empty. Our empty plates stayed in front of us after the appetizer and far into eating our main, then our server passed the table many times when our main was finished and didn't grab our plates then either. You would think they could've cleared them by the time we got our bill but no such luck. Ive never paid a bill and left before my empty plates have been cleared, wow just the absolute worst service. My pasta was way underdone. We ordered the vegetable platter for $10 and what a rip off that was, the only thing good on there was one of the cheeses which size-wise was a joke. The rest of the seasonal veggies they throw together in a small bowl in the middle so they all taste the same. Everything has meat or seafood except one or two dishes, so it's not too great if you're a vegetarian (however didn't ask if they offer tofu as a replacement). Very small menu. Dessert menu was not very appealing especially since I tried the tiramisu before here and it wasn't good. They got rid of the salad I liked so much last time .. boo. Will not be back! 

First review: 4 star

First time here I ordered the rigatoni pomodoro and the heritage tomato salad. Pasta was cooked absolutely perfectly, not one second overcooked! Also it was delicious, all the ingredients tasted well together, for one of their more simpler mains I was very impressed. Cheeses on both dishes were very fresh and tasty, also they use the real kind of Parmesan brick that they shave on to your dish as you please. Thumbs up for real parm. The salad was better than expected, heavy on the tomatoes (obviously considering the name), if you like tomatoes you'll love this. Salad was fairly big, I also got the marinated chicken which was fresh, juicy and a big size. I'm not a huge salad fan but I will order this salad over and over again when I come back, it's really that good. Also ordered two drinks, a ceasar and the hurricane. Ceasar was just average, also a fairly small size. The hurricane was much better, very citrus-y. The dessert was tiramisu, which in my opinion was not that great, wouldn't order again. I am a tiramisu fanatic and this one probably lands a 6 on a 10 scale. The restaurant is quite nice, a very rustic atmosphere. We had a very polite and friendly server but the service was slow the night I went (Friday evening) although they were about 90% full. I would come back based on the mains, and try a different dessert next time as well. Also hoping to have better service.",0,0,0

There is no seating area at this bakery however there are lots of baked goods from croissant sandwiches, chocolates to macarons of all sorts.

Though the macarons aren't as big as the ones from Morroco Chocolat, they have flavors that I haven't seen at any other bakeries such as Cotton Candy. 

I was filling up my box of dozen with my favorites and was unsure about the infamous salted caramel because from what I've tasted, I didn't see the hype. The worker was kind enough to let me sample a whole one and I loved it!

The food is awesome (some of the best I've ever had eating out) and the service was good, too.
I was surprised on how huge the portions were! And for the price, such a killer deal. I ordered the biscuits and gravy (which was served over mashed potatoes and topped with scrambled eggs.) And my boyfriend got the corned beef skillet. Both were to-die-for meals. We also noticed how tasty their eggs were, some of the best we've had.

The detailed work on each product makes me want to take a bite out of their edible designs. Their enormous amount of selections such as bath bombs, confections, slatherings, and soap slices can be an overwhelming experience and more so if you're an enthusiast of soap lather and fizz user. 

The staff is very helpful and will take time to answer all questions that you may have. This place absolutely took soaps and bath confections to the next level.

They are scarying beings really - they cover their mouths and  look into your mouth with layers of glasses while you're lying on a table with brightest possible light in your face. The sound of drills and smell of a dentist office is...far from pleasant and really makes you want to run the other way, even if it was leading off a cliff.

Well not anymore! I have now  become a fan of going to the dentist thanks to the friendly and caring staff at this office.

The first impression is ""Omg, you're  straight out of the 80s, need some reno."" you sit down and you see a wall filled with drawings by little children expressing how much they love their dentist and you think , ""you are so in for a rude awakening."" 

I felt like an 8 year old again sitting in this aged place -and you know what? I like it. I like it better than sitting in an slick office with sterile EVERYTHING that you're afraid to breath lest you contaminate . I hope they never reno -  it goes well with the caring and friendly staff who run this tiny office, that never fail to give you a ""you had a great check up;I knew you can do it"" bag - something I haven't received since I was a wee thing, and I confess, it made me want to care about my teeth more.

Every time I leave here - I feel well taken care of . You know that feeling you have - when your grandma takes care of you with her old remedies? you just feel completely at ease because you're in good hands? Well, that's what I get here -they're like - family...ish??

They don't have state of the art equipment here- but that's okay - because there is some human touch here -and even the dentists seem to really care. I've had my teeth looked at by all three dentists that work here - and they have always been nice, funny and concerned about my teeth and oral heath. It sounds like a horrible cliche but  I felt like they really were honest, caring dentists.

If you are all about going to a place with all the high tech equipment - this may not be for you(I went to one on Bay - and all my fillings also fell out- the equipment couldn't help a bad dentist); but if you want your visit to be pleasant and want to go to a dental office that genuinely care about your oral health - though they may not have the best equipment - this is definitely recommended.

It's teeny tiny and it's only because of Yelp that we even knew it existed and then decided to actually walk inside. It was Cinco de Mayo and we felt the need to enjoy some authentic Mexican cuisine. We turned to the trustee Yelp mobile app, Tacos Jalisco popped up so we thought, ""why not!? Yelpers approve, so it must be good."" We pull up to this divey little hole in the wall Mexican food shop off a residential street. We walk inside and they have pictures of food on the walls with numbers next to each one. I decided to order the #10 which was a quesadilla and a taco and my husband ordered the #7 which was the Carne Asada. I definitely won in the ordering department and that typically never happens. 

My quesadilla was pretty tasty and the accompanying taco was small enough to provide a taste without filling me up too much. However, the thing that stands out the most is their tortillas. They are homemade, authentically Mexican tortillas. Large and in charge tortillas. Buttery and soft tortillas. The #7 Carne Asada comes with a whole lot of meat and then a large tortilla. The meat is tasty but it could have used some cheese so it might be worth it to ask for cheese to be added. The quesadilla was just as a quesadilla should be, cheesy and yummy.

The Pros-
The location - right across the street from the Bellagio - so get a good seat and you get to see the fountains go off....and I'm a sucker for a good dinner view.
The salad - my Caesar salad was light and refreshing and not drenched in dressing.  
The portions - definitely looked like Goldilocks-sized portions..not too much, not too little. I think just right for the money.  
The service - our server was prompt and friendly and seemed eager to help us out. 
The ambiance - it reminds me so much of a place we have here in Pasadena (in terms of decor) called Pop Champagne Bar - kind of hip, romantic\/gothic, dark, candles everywhere, etc. 
The variety of desserts and milkshakes and 'fancy' drinks - need to give in to that sweet tooth of yours? It seemed like endless possibilities were available for that sort of thing - - milkshakes galore!
The fact that the Sugar Factory candy store is just across the way - so you can REALLY indulge that sweet tooth of yours.

The Cons-
The theme of the restaurant seemed really at a discord with the food of the restaurant.  I mean, it's an American Brasserie.  
My soup - My French Onion Soup, which I usually am a big fan of, was really salty and all the cheese was gooped up at the bottom, instead of being nicely melted and toasted at the top.  It still was good...but for me, definitely not good enough to finish my little cup portion. 
The reminiscent-of-Cheesecake-Factory feel - while the ambiance was pretty, everything about the place, decor, book-style menu, an unfocused menu...made me feel like I was at the Cheesecake Factory. Eh. Not my favorite of restaurants. 
The salad- yeah, I know this was above in the pros section. And I stand by the fact that my Caesar was pretty good.  I just wish the salad was a bit crisper.

All in all, it's one of those places you come because it's ""there""...or you need to entertain your children by sending em over to indulge in the sugar side while you try to enjoy yourself in the 'brasserie' side.  Probably won't be craving this place, but wouldn't be against coming here again.",7,2,3

The service is top notch just like at the truck.  The food is basicaly identical so I won't go into it except for the only difference as of last night, the super fries.

I also tried a friends pep fries, think animal style fries with bacon, smart!

Kurz gesagt:
Der Service war korrekt aber mehr auch nicht. Wir kamen ist voll besetzte Restaurant und wurden mehr oder weniger ignoriert.
Zur Küche:
Ich liebe die türkische Küche, aber das was ich vorgesetzt kam, empfand ich eher deutsch als türkisch. Die Optika war sehr ansprechend. Die Vorspeisenplatte war okay, bestand  auptsächlich aus verschiedenen Dips und Majosalaten, jedoch kaum Frisches, Gemüse nur in Spuren, Oliven Fehlanzeige. Naja - Geschmackssache, die Jungs fanden's toll. Alle Speisen sind nett arrangiert und eine Garnelen waren schön saftig. Die Beilangen gingen aber gar nicht, da teilweise Convenience. Zum Salat gibt es z.B. Fertigdressing  das Gemüse war zerkocht und schmeckte nach Brühwürfel.
Fazit: Sehr schönes Ambiente, die Küche für meine Ansprüche aber völlig überbewertet, jedoch dem Preisniveau angemessen. Man isst wirklich günstig und gut, mehr aber auch nicht.

This place really does have an insane selection of beer, both on tap, and by the bottle, domestic and imported. In fact, there is so much to choose from, it can really be a bit overwhelming.

Being from out of town, I really wanted to get something here that I wouldn't be able to order at home. That being said, he was kind of enough to point out some of the locally brewed beers and pointed out some of his personal favorites as well.

Although I cannot speak to the quality of their food, I would definitely recommend Sharp Edge Beer Emporium to anybody looking for a nice spot downtown to hang out and have a few drinks.

We were seated in plastic garden chairs and brought water. Our server then took our drink order. As my iced tea was delivered, she took our food order: Ginger-fried rice to share; scallops for her and a spicy crab roll for me. Her wine arrived five mins after the food. Drinks after food?

My sushi roll was okay but nothing special. The scallops were a bit small for the price but again, okay. The ginger fried rice was good. My hesitation?  The side dish was the best item.

Drinks: Gave our table a complimentary taste of a new Creamsicle cocktail (OJ, pineapple, and whipped cream vodka). It was sweet but good, dangerously good. I was feeling like a girl so I got a cosmo and my friends got margaritas (up and on the rocks). Solid cocktails. 1 bottle of Pinot Grigio. 

Food: We started w\/Fried Zucchini(apparently its a Pittsburgh thing to have planks of Zucchini because my friends were surprised)- Delish. My friends got pasta dishes that came with salads as well. I was filling up on drinks so I just got the crab app. Everything was awesome tho! 

Price: We got 3 cocktails, 1 bottle of wine, 2 apps, 2 dinners with salads. It broke down to $38 per person (3 people). Not terrible at all. 

SERVICE: PERFECT! Not overbearing but attentive.  Personally, I love when the owners are the servers it gives the place a quaint feel. We chatted about the Soup Contest. AWESOME SERVICE!

In WalMart a man came in with his gun and management asked him to leave. He cited the law and reminded them if they don't have a sign up notifying customers no weapons are allowed, he can go wherever he wants.

Why didn't Walmart know this law was now on the books? Why wouldn't they be prepared to either have a sign thwarting off a gunman in the toy department OR tell the rest of us to mind our business and respect the gun owners rights?

Either way, I would expect the largest discount retailer in the world to be prepared to address the issue with policies ahead of time.

The poor employees were nervous and so confused, including the elder cashier that initially reported the gunman. She was clearly shaken and upset. She told me she didn't know what to do, she thought maybe he was coming to shoot up the place.

First of all it's donuts so thats an easy 4 stars just for existing. The location is a bit tucked away which adds to the mystique of this dynamic donut experience. If you're staying in the downtown area and you have a free morning forget cheap steak and eggs. Bloody Mary's can wait... and a breakfast buffet is usually disgusting. These gourmet donuts will change the way you look at this breakfast novelty forever.

Anything with bacon comes with REAL bacon. Not those stingy little crumbles at other places. This bacon was thick cut, maple cured, and had a crunch that sticks to your jaws. EVERY SINGLE FLAVOR POPPED! The glazes are delicious and leave you with an angel like after taste. 

I suggest looking at the pictures. Try not to drop your phone with amazement. Yes the presentation is an important part of a business like this. The passerbys or window shoppers will NEVER be disappointed walking into this business. These oversized breakfast treats are worth every penny. 

Here's a few suggestions
- Creme Brulee ( it cracks when you bite into it)
- Brad Fritter ( its an apple fritter covered in caramel drizzle and a mountain of THICK cut bacon)
- The Homer ( its a giant donut just like the one from the Simpson's)
- Chai Latte ( it was like sipping on a cloud)

5th star factor for me was easily the mountain of bacon I received on top of my donut. It was definitely more then the 2 strips of loneliness you get at a Denny's or any other morning diner. The service was excellent, but damnit the bacon was over the top.",30,12,19

HOWEVER this trip was way different, we arrived on Wednesday 3\/5 and checked in no problem. Well my fiancé went golfing Thursday morning and took a shower before he left, I woke up to the worst smell ever. It smelt like nair and something burning all at once. I thought at first it was maybe the fan or something so I didn't say anything. I took a shower on Wednesday night and to my horror it was the water that smelt like. Thursday we went down and let the staff know, then went out on the strip. Well we got back late and found a letter saying that the problem was fixed by some one. Well of course I tested it, and surprise it was still smelling like death. At this point I'm upset because how has house keeping not noticed this smell. My mother in law walked in on Friday and asked me what that horrid smell was so I told her. Well she was even more upset and concerned about how safe it was to shower. A plumber came on Friday night and said it was the smell of sewage, so im thinking great I was showering in that. He said he just needed to use drain cleaner and everything was fine. Well woke up late sat and had to hurry off to the race track, came back sat to shower and the smell was still there, it actually got worse. I got nauseous everytime a shower was taken due to the smell. I actually was thankful that we had booked a couple of rooms for family, that I ended up showering in another room sun because I just didn't feel clean showering in the sewage smelling water.

And had I known that the primary users of the infamous ""folly trolley"" would be the same snotty, elitist Scottsdale pricks who - fresh off the plane from Los Angeles - regularly clutter up our freeways with all manner of comically inconsiderate driving-related antics, I would have commited voter fraud simply to prevent this ridiculous waste of state money's passage. But I digress.

The thought process of the think-tank that concocted this monument to instant obsolescence must have been as follows:

Stuffy Snobsdale Suit # 1: Alright, folks. Phoenix has a public transportation problem. But rather than address it by building something that goes faster and further than anyone could hope to go on Phoenix's impossibly congested freeways and streets, let's grandstand about greenhouse gas emissions and build a glorified trolley that - at maximum speed -  goes the bloody SPEED LIMIT.

Stuffy Snobsdale Suit # 2: I'm prepared to agree, provided that it stops at stop-lights and precludes the adjacent lanes of traffic from going forward, thus creating more problems than it ultimately fixes.

Stuffy Snobsdale Suit #1: DEAL! Now, on to pointless smoking ordinances...

*Ahem*

Oh, yeah, I rode the thing. Alot of people have been talking about the cleanliness of the cars... I would have to disagree on that one. Sure, the cabin doesn't reek of urine or anything, but some of the surfaces do have that dull, darkish dirtiness to them (think, the ball-pits at McDonald's). The colors of the car's innards remind you of maybe the New York subway system, but with less fecal matter (give it time)... and of course, with 99% less speed or usefulness. Honestly, the Universal Studios tour bus moves faster than this nearly-inert silvery heap. And while we're on the subject of its shiny exterior, who painted this pokey, pastel metal tube? I haven't seen this much pastel green since Miami Vice.

While I bemoan the primary passengers of the Metro Light Rail, I do have to laugh at their misfortune as a Tempe Soccer Mom finds herself sitting directly across from a smack-addicted hobo, even as I suddenly find myself humming the theme to 'The Odd Couple"".

My husband got an inside tip from a co-worker that knows that the owner purchases the fish the day it's flown in, so it was worth the drive to try it out. Now that we've made the trip & know that the quality of the fish they serve is top-notch, we will not hesitate to go back. Wish it was just a tad bit closer to home but that's my ""I don't want to get in my car & drive any further than I have to when it's 110 degrees"" side coming out. I will suck it up though & make the drive b\/c it's that good! 

We've been twice now & both times we have loved everything we've tried. I should preface this by saying that I am not a huge fan of all the ""fancy"" rolls that have become so popular over the last decade or so. I'm an old-school sushi eater, I like the simplicity of Sashimi & Nigiri. I like to taste the fish. When it's all wrapped up in a roll covered in sauces & tempura crunch, it can be very hard to tell if you're even getting a fresh piece of fish & that worries me a bit! 

The 1st time we went, I had a hankering for Salmon terriyaki & was not really in the mood for sushi. Maybe only the 2nd time in my life that has ever happened! I did order the Poki appetizer & it was AH-mazing. The salmon terriyaki was good although the sauce was way too thick & there was too much of it covering the fish. If I order it again, I will definitely ask them to go easy on the sauce! Hubby ordered the AYCE & from what I could tell, he enjoyed every roll he had. 

This last time we both had the AYCE & I will probably only do that from now on. It's a great value even if you don't eat very much & you can choose from hot & cold appetizers as well as all the sushi choices. I ordered the Poki again along with some Nigiri orders & even a couple of the ""fancy"" rolls, mainly b\/c I already knew that their fish was fresh. I liked the Angry Ninja & the Sushi twister roll the best. I think I could eat that Japanese salsa all by itself.. yum!  

I was slightly disappointed that they don't have fresh wasabi. Most of the better Sushi restaurants I've been to have it available for an extra charge so I was surprised they didn't have it. I have developed quite the affinity for it & can't really eat the stuff made from a powder anymore. I hope they consider making it available in the future & would be happy to pay an extra dollar or 2 to have some for my sushi. 

We will be bringing the kids next time. Sushi gets very expensive when we go out as a family but the AYCE deal will make it much more reasonable & they will be thrilled.. ""anything we want?!",0,0,1

I reserved our spot via 'no wait' and when we arrived on time, the hostess was rude and said we would have to wait another 20 min. Around 45 minutes later (and after checking in with her 2 times), we were finally seated. The hostess seemed pretty unhappy working there and talking to us, but she did express that something was wrong with the no wait app and that they were having issues all day. Either way, not a great way to kick off my brunch experience. 

The experience I then had with our server was bizarre. He was just immature. That's the nicest thing I can say. As soon as we sat down, he went into how long it would take to get our food -- 45+ minutes, so we should order appetizers or starve. He was right about the wait. It took over an hour to get my eggs benedict and I estimated that I was there for almost three hours from start to finish. It was so hot inside the restaurant, and just sitting there for almost three hours was torture. 

The food was mediocre and our server never checked on us. I had to hunt him down to get the check. Naturally, he never came to collect my money so I went to the front of the restaurant to find someone to pay. When I cashed out, I left my server the tip I felt he deserved. It was a $15 bill and I left him $2. I should have left him nothing because he was rude from the beginning and I saw him once during the entire brunch. I never leave a small tip and I never complain. It pains me to have to write this review but I was appalled at what happened next. When I handed him my receipt, he looked at my tip and called me out in the middle of the restaurant. He asked me why I didn't leave him a bigger tip. I tried to politely express my disappointment but he wouldnt let it go and he was loud. His response was that he has nine tables to serve. Wow. I was embarrassed with how unprofessional he was and just wanted to get out of there.

You must take a ferry if you want to bring a car or take the underground pedestrian tunnel. Getting through the airport is a breeze.

We tried the Guac and chips to accompany the local beers that we were indulging in. Did I mention they have an excellent selection of local beers. 

The tacos are their main attraction. The menu offers some innovative combinations like slow cooked pork with mole, Korean chicken and Bengali fish. I ended up trying the daily special which was chorizo along with the mole pork. The mole was well done but it was the chorizo, which I believe they prepare in their own kitchen, that stood out. The portions were sizable which is sad because I was too full to try the Korean pork by the end. 

The wings and the accompanying crema were possibility the best in Toronto. I could come to Tilde and just eat the wings and beer too.

k4LINHcLJfTDY1uUa095Sg,XMdDDalsRVxk8EPhACGpZw,vhu5zXMD5dSPFbq4suWTOw,4,2010-07-22,"I recently had something of a crisis. 

...and by crisis, I mean my computer blew its brains out. After pestering the living piss out of the gentleman next door (he works at Honeywell, but I've added ""Free Tech Support for Cassi"" to his letterhead for the time being) I was informed that my hard drive was a cheap turd likely manufactured from twigs by an enslaved infant in Thailand, which, I suppose, accounts for its six-month lifespan. 

'No big deal,' I thought. 'I'll just head over to the local electronics merchant and pick up a new one.' 

I'm a recent (legal, I swear!) English immigrant, and thusly, haven't had the opportunity to experience all the wonders of Phoenix, Fry's Electronics being among them (*Snort* I'm a nerd. We consider these things wonders). 

I was completely blown away by the sheer size of the place. It's like a Super Wal-Mart, except sans the roving hordes of unsupervised toddlers with full diapers knocking over everything in sight and screaming in spanish. And filled with expensive things. 

First off: a big thumbs up to the architect. Big stone columns and theme-park-style, sand-blasted aging done to the store logo? As I stepped into the glorious air conditioning, I found myself humming the theme to 'Jurassic Park'. And THANK YOU, to whomever laid the store out! The hard drives were right up front, so I didn't have to make a cross-country jaunt to the far corner of the store or anything. 

I was immediately accosted by a gentleman with what looked like a fauxhawk hairdo (Cassi didn't wear her contacts that day) and soon enough, the blonde, blurry mass asked if I was finding everything okay. ""Like, chya, broseph... I think I'm doing alright."" Unpleasant flashbacks to Zia Records. 

I was less than thrilled with their prices, but to be fair, I was looking for a REALLY big hard drive, so it would likely be expensive no matter where I got it. I was only bothered two more times, which is slightly less annoying than my same-day trip to Best Buy, where I had to fight my way to the checkout counter by beating their hard-selling associates away with my purse. So... good for Fry's, I guess?",2,6,3

sO7tR2GHpgHP-Rh8RTq4xA,a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,3,2012-12-19,"Ok. With an open mind (that means locals have to set aside their local criticism...) I think this place is fun. THIS PLACE IS GREAT FOR VEGAS VISITORS AND TOURISTS. Most people are looking for a fun experience and it could be in the most cliche way as possible. 

I think the main point here is the EXPERIENCE. The experience of an extensive dessert menu and the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory vibe. It's super fun, and such a cute interior. They've got a nice bar inside the restaurant, and right next door is the Sugar Factory dessert and souvenier shop that you can look around in.

Ok so here's my food critique:

SALMON AND ASPARAGUS- Honestly, it SCREAMS over priced. You get 7 pieces of asparagus and a like a 1\/3 slab of salmon for $25.00. The salmon was TOO salty, but I must admit that I did like that nice outter crisp that it had, and the tender inside. The asparagus was on point as well. It had a nice smokey flavor with bacon bits, and it was really crunchy. Seriously though, the price versus quality and portion was just plain (ROBBERY). 

If price isn't your main concern I'd still recommend you try it AT LEAST once for the experience. 

FRIED MAC AND CHEESE- that was actually a good appetizer and it was tasty. Of course it had the nice crispy outter breading with the soft cheesy mac and cheese interior. It comes with five pieces and pairs their special sauce. I'd recommend this for an appetizer. 

The best part here are the goblets. YOU COME FOR THE GOBLETS AND THE DESSERT. I think. The goblets are $36 for a 32 ounce drink (you don't keep the cup but for $15 more you can). 

We got the WHITE GUMMY GOBLET and the BLUE OCEAN GOBLET. The WHITE GUMMY GOBLET was very fruity and tart so if you liek that type of flavor I'd suggest that one, and it comes with fun creey crawly gummy worms inside! I ordered the BLUE OCEAN it has that very strong HYPNOTIQ taste to it (duh...janel because it has Hypnotiq inside) It's not too strong, and not too sweet. It also has fun swimming shark gummies in there (Careful! They bite!)

The fun part about that is, they pour your drink into the goblet when it reaches your table then a bunch of fog comes out of your goblet like a witches potion so you enjoy the thrill of others looking at your drink and saying ""oooo...ah...I want what they have..."" (because that's basically what you're buying.)

They also have small martini concotions as well and I'd grab that chance during happy hour where it's buy one get one on drinks. And...that's it!",3,0,0

Its more than just playing around and shooting each other, its a chance to experience and learn about how a real gunfight would go down, and how just because your opponent is out of ammo, does not mean he wont come in and try to tackle you to the ground. Not only was the actual experience itself great, but the owner, Nephi, and his helper Jesse were great.

My boss and I dined here and he was treating me out for my 26th birthday so we ordered the omakase plus extra sushi. 

I came in here around 9pm and first thing I noticed was that there were not that many fishes available for some reason and I believe this contributed to how small our sushi pieces were. I felt like the chef gave us only what he had remaining and had very few premium fish left. The quality is decent, (nothing that amazing) and the portions were extremely small. I believe the waitress was the chef's wife and she was extremely nice to us even telling the chef to give some service since it was my b-day and we came out from LA just to try this place.. Chef told her okay, but it never ended up happening. Just for my boss and I we spent close to $400 including drinks for very mediocre sushi and will definitely not return. Don't even know what to recommend because nothing really stood out.

Overall subpar sushi, decent service, low quantity, and very expensive. Not sure if it's because I just came at a bad time when the chef had no good premium fishes left, but my experience here was nothing but horrible.

I should have known before visiting that I wasn't going to like the place. After all, the AZ Repugnant rated this place as its #2 pick (behind Matt's Big Breakfast) as the top place to have breakfast in the Valley.  As the six friends who read my reviews know, I've never understood the hoopla around Matt's Big Breakfast - it's OK - but geesh -- #1?  What happened to The Farm at South Mountain -- now that's a unique-fantastic-organic-only-can-find-in-Phoenix-Phoenician experience.

Sigh - but I digress...

Ross and I enter ""Kiss the Cook"".  The interior is special - hard wood floors, mismatched seats and tables -- we both say it reminds us of a country store.  ""Nana"" is the one who shows us to our seats.  My hopes rise and I start thinking that AZ Republic scored on it's review.

We order.  Service is friendly, coffee was a little weak, but Ross loves the OJ.  Then the food arrives. 
 
The presentation is impressive.  My omelet was TALL!  FLUFFY!  Both Ross and I were wowed!  Then I cut into it and it was runny, soggy, and tepid (not really warm).  The waitress came by, asked how everything was (and she seemed to really mean it versus the polite ask but they don't really care to know the answer question that usually comes from waiters).  I told her about the omelet and she offered for them to recook it.  

She came back with my same omelet that must have been thrown in the microwave.  The top was steaming but interior now warmer - but not yet warm.   I picked around the soggy parts and ate the top (that was Ross' suggestion).

The waitress came back again, concerned that I wasn't eating enough.  She was so sweet.  I didn't want to make her feel badly.  But she sent the manager over -- which I thought was very proactive customer service.

The manager (maybe the owner?), stopped by and asked me what I thought might be wrong and offered up that it might be the egg beaters.  She did not offer me something else (but did suggest the next time I go in I should try the Pecan Cinnamon Roll).  And, when we got our bill, the omelet was still on it (they didn't comp my meal).

The reason for the low star rating is for the poor customer service. This was my first time eating here and honestly I don't know much about Mediterranean food.

Instead of telling me some of their popular items, he began to read off the menu (which I don't understand why since I can read it myself).

I showed him my check in (since they had a Yelp check in offer for free baklava) and he asked me for my name to confirm my check in. After I told him, he said he didn't see it on his register. I even showed him my Yelp check in and he kept on saying he couldn't see it even though it was right there on my phone.

mustard was a great choice to go with it..the only disappointment was wild rice.... since it's been puffed in a way like rice crispy and lost it's own scent and 
flavor.... I was expecting it to taste stronger. ^^

Main : We both chose sirloin dish.

Me - Blue ( love juice so much and did not want to loose any!) GF - Med-rare ( we had to return this to cook more because for my GF, it was a bt undercooked but they replaced the dish without any hesitation. )

Gherkin Sour cream.... never tasted it so wondered how good it will be....
the result? - it was superb~!!!! My blue was juicy and full of flavor!!!!!
I was smiling all the time!!! little side of Braised ribs ( although it could not contain it's original form) added little twist and again, mixed with juice and sour cream, it helped to create layers of different taste on each bite!  - it was interesting to feel how the taste changed when I try different ratio of those 3 components.

Dessert -  This is where I had to drop may be 0.5 stars ..... 

I had  3 milk cake and GF had Carrot cake. My cake was rich and flavorful.... but little dry.....I was expecting to taste more moist in them.........

GF's Carrot cake...... it was her birthday so they decorated the plate with cute message and a candle.. but it was also dry......she told me the taste is amazing but as she chew more..only the dryness remains... May be they were outside for a long time?

each dish came with candid walnut and peanuts on the side - Again, tasted great but because cakes were dry...........It did not mixed well as a whole dish.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Will i go there again? Defiantly... Was it worth the money we paid? Of course. Will I recommend this restaurant to friends and others? YES!

In overall, we had great time and each dishes were unique and tasty.
Desert was not up to what we expected but we did not order a la cart.
As a Winterlicious restaurant, Canoe did better than few other places
which we been through and it's location - top of the TD tower - with beautiful view outside really satisfied both of us.

The restaurant opens for lunch at 11am, but the ""boss"" doesn't get back from grocery till much later. As a result, the restaurant sometimes lacks even the most basic ingredients for their menu items such as tofu or curry powder. The waitstaff had offered to let us choose from the dinner menu (for which they had the necessary ingredient in stock) at lunch price, only to be denied by the boss upon his return. 

If you are not particular about what to order, then this place may be for you; in fact, it looks to be quite popular with elderly Chinese folks. If you have a fine taste for Chinese food - or if you care about customer service - then stay away from this place. From what I understand, it's quite often for certain menu items - including their ""specials"" - to be unavailable. And this is inexcusable, considering there is a huge Chinese supermarket across street.  

There are many other Chinese restaurants in Vegas; in fact, China Mama in the same plaza has an extensive menu, always accompanied by great customer service.",1,0,0

Apparently they had sold too many which made it very difficult to get an appointment locked down. Every time I called they said they would call me back the next day with a time, but it never happened. Finally I asked my boyfriend to call to try and sweeten them up for an appointment, and he was successful. Entering the Spa, its clear they have tried to update the waiting area with trendy couches and TV's but its kind of a mix of stylish and the 1990s. The staff was accommodating and I didn't wait long to start my massage. She was EXCELLENT, the massage was so relaxing. She only asked me a few times if I was ok, which was perfect for me because I didn't really want to talk! If you want a massage go see Milena! As for the Mani\/Pedi, I was told straight away by the manicurist that the pedicure was NOT a full pedicure, ok whatever. She was decent, seemed like she was rushing, kind of ""just doing her job."" She offered me a coffee and was nice enough but I just felt rushed and I was just another pair of feet and hands to hurry up and get out. 
Keep in mind, I was the youngest person in there at 27, the other ladies were all 50+. I think this place is still in business because of all the old ladies that have kept loyal to the business for years and years. I wouldn't go back, the Groupon was definitely a good deal though!",9,1,0

The bloke isn't a fan of tapas either, for similar reasons to me. But we both toddled along to Indaba due to all the good reviews on Yelp. It's a fusion of Spanish and South African food, so already a bit quirky and odd, and there's this guy who I think is the owner and he's quirky and odd too. So it's all quite unusual in its presentation. 

The restaurant is always packed. You need to book in advance for this place. The windows are sweaty and there are strange paintings and ornaments throughout. But my, the food is gooooooood. 

Even with the tapas theme, my other half and I chowed down to a range of dishes and each and every one was delicious. I will definitely be back here.

The marscopone creme on top of the pancakes was to die for. The Pancakes itself were light, soft and fluffy and paired quite well with the creme and the maple syrup on the side.

To be honest, my friend ordered the croissant with eggs and smoked salmon and I found that MUCH tastier than the Pancakes. The Pancakes were too filling for me, whereas the croissant came with a small salad and a healthy serving of smoke salmon. The smoked salmon wasn't too salty and balanced the sweetness of the pastry.

The pizza has flavor...something that is missing from a lot of places... the cheese has that good salty taste of real pizza with sauce that also makes you want more. I for one like to opt for pepperoni and green olives as the perfect combo of taste. The pizza here if you get the New York style by the slice is huge and they have a wonderfully huge party pan pizza that is so huge that they have on going contest for two people to eat one to get your photo on the wall. They also have a Sicilian pizza if you are into that sort of thing  as well which is huge. Wings are good and they do a slice deal with wings and a beer at some locations that is pretty affordable.

Die zu der Zeit noch sehr nette Bedienung, nahm die Personenzahl im Reservierungsbuch auf und versicherte mir, dass sie bei der Pizza eine Ausnahme machen würden  die gibt es nur zum Mittagstisch , da es ja relativ viele Kinder seien. 
An dem besagten Tag ab 18.00 Uhr war für 6 Personen gedeckt anstatt für 9 !  der Fehler wurde nach Diskussion über Schuldzuweisung behoben. Als dann die Kinder  wie bereits angekündigt  gerne Pizza wollten, kam der Chef, der uns zuvor nicht einmal durch Nicken o.ä. begrüßt hatte ( es ergab sich dann aus dem Gespräch, dass er der Chef ist ) an unseren Tisch und diskutierte wieder  Schlussendlich bekamen die Kinder keine Pizza, da kein Teig? da war? Ich hatte gute Lust zu gehen, wollte den Abend aber nicht noch mehr vermiesen !!!
Wir haben dann alle dort gegessen, das Essen war soweit gut, bis auf die Spaghetti Bolognese der Kinder, die kalt und sehr trocken aufgrund Soßenmangels war. Der Chef hat uns keines Blickes mehr gewürdigt und uns komplett ignoriert  die Bedienung war uns gegenüber sehr verhalten und somit war das dann auch unser letzter Besuch dort. Preis-Leistung geht m.E. gar nicht.
Es gab absolut keine Entschuldigung vom Chef, so unter dem Motte: Tut uns leid, da lag wohl ein Mißverständnis vor.. o.ä. Die Rechnung wurde einer Person von uns gesamt überreicht, obwohl eindeutig hervor ging, dass es 2 Familien waren  es wurde hier auch keinesfalls bedienungsseitig nachgefragt wie wir die Rechnung gerne hätten.

We have been to the Arcadia location many times and count it as one of our favorite eating destinations in Phoenix. However, a combination of problems added a sour note to an otherwise nice evening.  

The first problem -- apparently the kitchen lost track of our salad -- would have been understandable for a new operation.  Plus, to their credit, Postino did not charge for the salad.  However, our server compounded the problem by trying to close our bill while we were enjoying our meal culminating with her giving us our check before I had finished eating said salad.  Not only did we feel rushed out of the restaurant but we had intended to order dessert!

I have always admired the wait staff at the Arcadia location for their professionalism that seemed to support a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience. The Gilbert location stumbled on both accounts.  We'll assume this new operation will resolve these bugs and hope to return to this location.

I've come here a couple times and all the others, the service was quick and awesome and everything came out in a timely manner.

We waited for about 15-20 minutes for a seat (seats were open but took forever to be cleared from previous guests), and then a full hour for our food. The food was great except for a salad, which was supposed to have avocados on it. First try, there's no avocados. Second try, the avocados are rotten. Third and final try, the waitress brought us a few not great slices and said ""Those are the best ones we got."" So obviously at this point, we're pretty irritated but we have our food and we're not going to complain and cause a scene. We eat, it's great. Happy people. Then comes the bill.

zMn-ZYIH54yr4PEq2DSu-g,jqyS91iI63nyztPAvRk1AQ,nhMHfbBSA10d7St6eRHBVw,2,2016-07-11,"This is a particularly difficult review for me to write.  I have my concerns.  
I am American, but come from a family of immigrants (from India).  My wife is an immigrant from Vietnam. 

On 07\/07\/2016 my wife and I went to Max's Mukhaase for dinner.  We arrived at around 6:15 PM.  The following are my observations:

1) The place needs climate control.  It is so hot.  Please either fix the air conditioner, or please use it.  Please close the doors, and let the air conditioner do its function and manage the heat. 

2) Please seriously look into how the front and the back are managed.  It appears as though you have a lot of wait staff just sitting around, not knowing what to do.  There needs to be a set routine regarding cleaning, tending to customers, and managing the front.  Please set some ground rules.  It appears as though there is absolutely no management on the front of the business. 

3) My wife and I were seated at 6:15 PM on 07\/07\/2016.  We received our food at 8:00 PM.  The average person would have walked off, and not waited.  Was it worth the wait?

4) The manner in which the food is served makes all of the difference.  Try to serve all parties at a table at the same time.  We were lucky this happened, but we saw many customers where there was a gap of time of nearly 45 minutes.  In the West, this is inexcusable.  

5) The noise level was actually very excessive.  I know it is a party atmosphere, and it is crowded, but turning down the music appropriately helps.  

6) Also the management of food preparation needs to be looked at.  This perhaps goes back to the business model you have.  You need to find ways to be more efficient in the kitchen, the back end.  You need to find ways to make the food with appropriate quality, relative to the cost, in a timely manner. Seriously look at how you can increase capacity (maybe a kitchen manager is needed?  Maybe a skilled helper?).  What can be pre-made?  What is fast moving?  What is slow moving?  

This may mean paring down the menu to a few things.  This may mean restructuring to having a buffet only.  This may mean going from a full restaurant to going to a walkup kiosk at a food court.  This may mean scaling back and only doing catering.  You may only want to do a take-out and nothing else.  

7) As you can see, I have not even mentioned directly on the food yet.  The food quality was okay, but there are a few things that concern me.  My wife and I ordered:
* Goat Stew, Waakye, Gari and Salad

I ordered a burger with spinach, Brie, onion and aioli on a pretzel bun. The burger itself  was good (nothing spectacular) . The bun was yummy and fresh, but there were some flaws with the toppings. The Brie was mostly rind, very little creamy Brie goodness. The spinach was steamed, which I thought was super odd since it was listed in the same group as lettuce. I asked for fresh spinach and the waitress said she didn't know if they had any because they usually cook it all in the morning. Wait, so the spinach on my burger that I ordered at 3:30 was cooked early this morning? The waitress ended up bringing out fresh spinach so that was good. 

We also had a wedge salad. Nothing special and actually mediocre at best. One little piece of bacon, minimal blue cheese and the dressing was runny. 

I have no problem spending money on an awesome burger, but I do have a problem spending $20 on a nothing special burger that I feel like I could have made just as good (if not better at home).",1,1,0

The first time they seated us down a long hall in a back bar room that seemed to be in another building. Our server\/the bartender was gone as in not in the back bar\/eatery 90% of the time. The other bartender helped with most everything. Bringing our food, drinks, refills, asking if we needed dessert, wanted boxes. I ended up leaving a good tip because of the good food and great service we got from the guy who wasn't our server. Though after leaving I spoke with a manager on the phone and said I wanted half the tip to go to the other guy.. giving name and details of this man. Providing a statement as to why this man deserved it.

When I was eating at a full dinner meeting. We had decent service I was surprised the server as well as the manager seemed to not be friendly to our meeting leader who is a very wealthy and powerful person. When asked to see the larger spaces they both said it was closed right now.. not messy, nobody was using it, they just didn't want to show it. Our meeting leader ended up mentioning who would be sponsoring an event there, and what sort of people would go then the manager jumped to help. It was off putting to see this happen.

It was pretty good so I decided to go with the Fancy Nancy which is supposed to have apples, grapes and pecans mixed in. Well if there were any of those items in there I sure couldn't taste it or see it. Seemed to be just plain chicken salad like the sample I had gotten before ordering. It was still good but I was a little disappointed because I wanted more flavor.  I ended up mixing in the grapes from my fruit side just to have some taste. The portion size was a little smaller than expected (I've been to other chicken salad places in AL that serve a larger size) but it was adequate although an hour later I'm hungry again. I looked over the allergen menu and while I'm glad all of their chicken salads are gluten free, I was a little surprised to see that there is MSG in the pimento cheese, two of the chicken salads and two out of the four soups.

 Having been to the (original?) Mother India in Glasgow, I had high expectations of the Mother India Cafe. Whilst the décor is decidedly more modest, and the dining experience a little less refined, the food is easily as good.


 Of particular note was the Garlic Chilli Chicken - which after an initial ""is this meant to be hot?!"" had us all reaching for the lassi - but in a very good way.


 I suspect this place would be better in a group than as a couple (we were four) - but either way it's definitely worth a visit.

I have been in search for the best burger in Charlotte (a perfect 10 burger is an In 'n' Out Double Double) and figured I'd try Topz.

I did get the all angus burger on a healthy wheat bun, but felt the burger was average overall.  Nothing overly flavorful or juice about it.  On top of that, a side option was fries, which is imperative to have with a burger.  The fries were average too.  I noticed them taking the pre-cut fries out of a manufacturer's bag.  Sigh.

Overall, my impression of Topz was average.

We had Rick's Adobo Fried Rice - a traditional Filipino dish made with marinated, shredded chicken and rice wrapped omelet style with green onions, accompanied with their homemade macaroni salad. The omelet is exactly what one would expect, if you ever had adobo...VERY, VERY GOOD! The mac salad was a little salty for my taste, but still very good!

Their Kalua Pig Benedict - toasted English muffin, topped with Hawaiian-style, slow-cooked, shredded pork, cabbage, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce...A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  If benedicts are what you're looking for, this one tops them all. My absolute favorite!

Our son had their bacon cheeseburger, well done, and fries. My husband was quite pleased and surprised that, yet again, another great entree! 

Our daughter had their carrot cake pancakes. I love carrot cake to begin with, and I have to admit that it was even better than I thought!

To top everything off, we ordered their Red Velvet Pancakes with chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup. If pancakes are what you're looking for, anyone who's been here would, I'M SURE, highly recommend the Red Velvet. Words cannot even describe such a simple dish that is OH SO, well...you'll just have to try it!!!  

Don't think that we could eat all this. I'm actually sick to my stomach from all the amazing food! We packed up two take-home containers and went home to crash, but I wanted to take a moment to rate this restaurant. Definitely worth it. This being our first time there, we wanted to order so much off their menu to try what we heard\/read rave reviews about, so we already knew we were ""taking leftovers""...the question was, just how much?

Being New Year's Eve, it was really packed! They served us juice and coffee as we waited, which was extremely nice! You're happy with how their items are priced! Service was still very good for how busy it was.  EVERYONE, including us, walked out of there with a smile on their face.

If this existed in our area, we'd practically live here. 

The only downside is it's not on the Strip, so if your reasons for being in Vegas put you on the Strip all the time, you have to go out of your way and maybe you don't have time for that. We happened to be visiting friends who live nearby and that's how we knew about it. If you're not renting a car, this is out of the way of anything you might be doing on the Strip that you could otherwise walk to.

She quoted me at $960 a month. It was a steal for that unit. We had everything figured out. The day I went to sign my lease it was $59 more a month. I asked what happened. She said I missed the deal because I viewed the property at the end of the month an accepted before the promotion ran. I LATER SPOKE WITH ANOTHER TENANT IN PASSING WHO SAID THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO HER AND I NEVER EVEN MENTIONED THAT IT EVER HAPPENING TO ME. 

I'll get into the way they set up your utilities in a minute.

The day I signed my lease any courtesies stopped. My washer and dryer leaked all over my tiling. I still don't know which appliance it was. I stopped calling after the third time it wasn't fixed. I was tired of them banging on my door, looking at it and saying, ""yeah that should do it."" 

I eventually got another job and tried to do what I could to get out of my lease. Not happening. She said, ""there's nothing you can do about...,"" meaning legally. I asked for numbers about having it re-rented they were charging me several hundred dollars just to re-show the apartment. 

You're charged a monthly rate by the utilities companies on top of everything. My apartment has been vacant for two months and I just got a $79 utility bill in the mail. My refrigerator is unplugged. Air is off. I have no idea why its so much. 

Could've been a nice place. Could've been 5stars. But some policies are horrible. The people there are terrible. The people there take no pride In their jobs and are horrendous.

Located in an old shopping center, the outside is pretty noticeable with a big sign of its name. It seems to be the only place in its area getting business. 

Came around 1p and the place was pretty busy that we had to get seated at a bigger booth. The inside's decor has a little bit of cheesy factor but they did try to bring New Orleans to Vegas with their colors. 

We ordered coffee, beignets, fried okra, fried mac and cheese, two streetcar poboys, and a bread pudding. I'm not a fan of the sliminess of okra so I can't say much about it but surprisingly, the fried mac and cheese was a lot better than expected. You get a few pieces of bacon mac and cheese nuggets accompanied with a side of ranch. I recommend it. After those came out, our waitress came over to bust out some bad news. No beignets...and it was one of the main things I was looking forward to. She said they were rolling out some new dough and if it was ready by the time we got to dessert, she'd gladly serve it. Oh well. The poboys come with a small side of fries and cole slaw. A regular size is pretty filling. Overall, I wasn't amazed by the sandwich. It was good but simple. I added a touch of hot sauce to each bite. For me, the bread pudding outshined the sandwich. I opted for the one without raisins and it was served in a coffee mug all warmed up and gooey from the sauce. Don't skip on it.

Like other reviews have mentioned, service is spot on. The ladies here make sure you're doing alright and consistently check up on you. They're friendly and full of energy.

I searched, researched, decided, un-decided, figured out, couldn't figure out, what to do for my 50th birthday in Vegas...........until I stumbled upon the Disco Bus in one of my late night Google sessions - and holy geezus crickets, am I glad I did! I'm 50 now (yeah, I just like to say that ;-) ), so I've got lots of years and experience behind me, and this trip - was one for my record books. How do I say ""It was so much fun!"" but emphasize that statement like it was on steroids with an IV caffeine drip? Yeah, that's how fun it was. In a text conversation with a girlfriend today reminiscing about our Disco Bus adventure over the weekend, she says: ""I don't think I'll ever go to Vegas again and not rent it, I'd even enjoy that shit if was alone!"" :-)

The Disco Bus owner, Vincent, was so easy and pleasurable to deal with from the day I put down my first deposit until he picked us up on my birthday night. We probably had communications 3-4 times before arriving in Vegas and he always responded to me within 24 hours (usually much, much quicker)! He's also got a sexy French accent, not that it matters, but yeah, he does , haha! 

The bus arrived at 8:00 p.m. on the dot! (scheduled time was 8:00 p.m.), and as promised, everything was set and ready to go the minute we embarked. The bus is HUGE, beautiful, immaculate, and a true ""nightclub on wheels,"" as they advertise. I ""ordered"" a bartender, and that's probably the best thing I could've done; while you bring your own alcohol, it was wonderfully easy to just hand it all to him and have him make our drinks for the entire journey. I ordered the Soft Drink Package to go along with it so the sodas, cranberry juice, etc., were cold and prepped when they arrived. I also ordered some glow sticks - get those too, they're fun! You can stick them in your pants and laugh, I mean, if you want to. 

Vincent was also our DJ, and he did himself proud! We shook our asses from departure to arrival! The 2 hours went quickly, so quickly, but the trip was timed perfectly with a stop at the Las Vegas sign, and then a stop downtown for a restroom break - where we ended up grabbing some additional people off the street to enjoy our bus with us! 

There were 13 of us on the bus........and yes, I can see that you can SEAT 40 comfortably, but that many would probably have been too crowded for me - I enjoyed being able to dance down the center aisle from the bar up front to the stripper pole in back........where I may or may not have fallen - but hey, I'm 50 now remember? so there's just another experience under my belt. 

RENT THE DISCO BUS!! It's one of the best things I ever did for myself!

- Onion Ring Tower
- Roasted Turkey Melt
- Cuban Roast Pork Dip
- Five Ounce Blackened Tuna Burger
- Mediterranean Seared Scallops
- Mini Chocolate Souffle

So-so:
- Fried Calamari

Didn't like:
- Seared Ahi Steak Sandwich: tuna was not trimmed neatly. Had a hard time eating it because it was tough and gristly. One would expect Ahi Steak to almost melt in your mouth...
- (Mac + Cheese)2: didn't smell very appetizing. After I ate it, I kept thinking I was going to get sick. I don't know if it was the wild mushrooms, but definitely not getting that again!
- Spicy Jambalaya: It was just ok, but nothing beats a Jambalaya with fresh ingredients

We were also in the mood to have some margaritas so we figured perfect! We ordered our fiesta nachos and the nacho burger nachos or something like that, both of which were super yummy. We had a super nice server named Luis who gave us great service and sold us on not getting individual margaritas. He said we'd be better getting the pitchers cause we could get 4-5 margaritas each for less price so we were like done! Took 2 pitches between 5 of us. When he came out pouring the first pitcher it only filled up 4 of them just over half way. He had to use some of the second pitcher to fill ours more but then stopped half way through the second he realized we were clearly being shorted. He left with the still half pitcher and came back with it filled back up. In the end we all only had 1-1.5 drinks each. One of my friends asked for a manger and explained to him the situation and just felt like we were a little shorted and we were really nice about letting him know. Honestly we probably could've gone without even mentioning it and leaving barely satisfied with the situation but we decided let's just let him know. The first thing out of his mouth when we explained to him he said so you only had 1 1\/2 drinks each? That's hard to believe. Ok no big deal. We just elaborated and he seriously did not care AT ALL about it. He was like well I sent you out a whole new pitcher and we were like well you took the half filled pitcher back first and just filled it with ice. After the shortest discussion ever he literally said ok well have a good night. I work in a customer service industry as a manager and it's our job to, even if there's not much we can do, to make sure the customer is happy. I'm not exactly sure how he was trained as manager or if customer service is of ANY important to Nacho Daddy but that was my first experience with the company and it's left a sour taste in all of our mouths because of it. The managers name was Rob apparently and I can't express the extent of how he just could not be bothered with us and in no way were we ""those"" kind of customers. We just wanted to let him know and he gave two shits about it. I don't know if any of us will come back, who knows.

I like the fact that he's the kind of gun salesman who will tell you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear. Often times other stores will try to persuade you to buy their most expensive selection. 
The store itself has got a great selection of items including nfa stuff.  He has a great selection of suppressors that other stores are sold out on. Jason made my first local suppressor buying experience quick and painless. He takes care of all the paperwork and mails it out himself. Hint: Bring a checkbook instead of a credit card for payments to the ATF. 
The store is also right next door to the green valley gun range so it does get pretty busy. Jason and his wife were the only two people there at the time so it is difficult to see, speak, and acknowledge every customer going in. I understand that. I think they would benefit from a number\/ticketing system to keep track of who is next in line.

It's huge inside, bigger than any Starbucks I've been in (are there bigger?) and the layout is such that you can wait for folks without feeling like you're on top of anyone. 

2. The staff is incredible. Not in that fake\/corporate-y\/Starbucks sort of way, but genuinely incredible. Kind and patient while I sorted through coins that all looked the same and quick to churn out my super complicated drink of choice... don't ask... really. 

3. The architecture is really cool. Now I can't say whether or not this is because it's in a cool\/old historic building or if Starbucks came in and wow-ed the place up, but I dig the furniture, the artwork, the lighting, the tile, and the overall feel.

Keen to try out the new digs, I found a day that had a decent hockey game on and assumed they would carry over the sporting theme.  With a name like Stix & Stones, you'd expect a pool lounge and sports bar.  Well, they've got a pool table, and TVs that show sports in a surrounding that is more an attempt at urban chic than cozy sports bar or pool hall.  It's nice enough, but not what is expected, considering the main door still has the old Shoeless Joe baseball bat door handles welcoming you in.  The construction outside pretty much hides the restaurant from plain view, so they're already are kind of behind the eight ball.

The menu is wide and has usual pub faves.  If the nachos are an indicator, food will have high and low points.  The array of multi-coloured chips and the amount of toppings were great, presented in a long stylish plate different from most other nacho platings.

Michelle travels to your place to give massages (but I also believe she has a location that you can go to her if you rather do that).  I have been getting massages from her every other week since more than a year ago (hahah, I know, i am addicted).  I get 90 mins each time and love it.  Because of the good pricing, I can get a longer massage than what I can get outside.  Most of the time, I fall asleep during my massages BUT the best part is I can go back to sleep after she leaves! (because I am at home and don't need to be driving around after I get my massage)  She does great massages overall, but my favorite is the head and neck massage.  Honestly, I 've been to many many massage therapists and so far Michelle does THE best head massage!   Specially when I have headaches, the massage can seriously be sedative! waahahha",5,1,4

We had the usual: miso, salad, rolls, and tempura. The quality was without doubt, and the service was without flaw.

I am the pizza man.

So I happened across this yelp page about three weeks ago and thought I would give it a chance. Everybody kept mentioning the garlic knots, and the place had a great score, so I thought, why not?

Anyway, since that day I've purchased at least 7 times from Bistro Pizza! I can't get enough!

THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA IN HENDERSON. 

Let's go over it in detail:

Dough: Obviously made from scratch. I can tell that each batch varies slightly in gluten development because some days the crust has been a little chewier or a little less chewy. The chef stretches the dough by hand - an absolute must to get the perfect pizza crust. The made-from-scratch dough is the BEST because you end up with that chewy, flavorful crust that makes ALL the difference. I'm assuming it's the same dough used in the garlic knots, which disappear like cocaine in a rehab facility.

Sauce: I'm not 100% this is home-made, but it sure tastes like it is. It is good. Not too strong and paste-y like pizza hut, not bland like so many other places. It has a great acidity and tomato flavor. If the pizza has a weak point it's the sauce, but if that's the weak point, it's not very weak at all.  

Toppings: Great toppings. Obviously there's a certain ""standard"" that every pizza place meets in what it uses for toppings, however, one thing I love about Bistro Pizza is that they don't skimp to save a few cents like many other places do. You can watch the chef make your pie and he isn't skimpy with the cheese or toppings. 

Price: just right. Very competitive prices and you get the highest quality pie in the area. 

Garlic knots, as I mentioned, are wonderful pizza-dough creations. For bread-lovers like me, they're perfect. 

Speed is great. It's not a factory like pizza hut or dominoes, obviously, but they compete time-wise. A lunch of a small pizza and soda could easily be had in a half hour.",1,0,0

The free drinks were Palomas (tequila and grapefruit based) and another drink of OJ, orange vodka, and something else. Pretty refreshing in the heat. I bought a pitcher of delicious strawberry mojito too, for $45 and it served 6 girls.

There are water bowls everywhere and a section with kiddie pools that you can fill with water for the pups to play in.  All the dogs seem to be really friendly the few times that we have gone.  There are plenty of places for owners to sit. The only down side is one section has benches facing each other in a square pattern.

Disclaimer: I love MEC.  They're a great company, they do great things.

I normally do all my bike repairs by myself.  I love working with my hands.  I have very low expectations from bike mechanics.

I showed up in business casual with my old beater of a bike.  The mechanic was assertive, not knowledgeable, tried to upsell and put me in a difficult situation.  

I went in to find a replacement spoke for my back wheel and deal with a chain slippage problem.  I figured my chain stretched, but I wanted an expert opinion.

They had a look at the bike, measured up the chain and said ""yep, stretched.  And we replace the cartridge when we replace the chain.""

I guess I should be tougher on these guys.  As soon as they said ""cartridge"", I knew he didn't know what he was talking about.  But I also knew he was right that my back gear cluster was worn.

So I asked him ""how much to replace the cluster?""

""$30 labour, $15 for the cluster.""

I figured.... it'll cost me $20 for the tool to do it myself, and I don't have a bench vice, so I'm glad to have them do the work.

""Go ahead""

""It can be ready in 40 mins, you can pay up by the cash.""

So I paid the bill, then came back after 40 mins.  He saw me and told me ""hey, I've got some bad news.  Your freewheel is stuck.  We can't get it off""

Then he tells me ""we've got this wheel here, it's not a great wheel, but it's better than what you've got.  Your old steel rim is pretty rough.""

""That's alloy. there's barely any steel on that bike.  This is not a Canadian Tire beater. ""

Here's where I got into a sticky spot.  I've already paid for the labour, the money is gone.  I could return the parts and head out, or I could have them swap out the wheel.  I was really reluctant... because the only reason I had them do any work on my bike was to remove the freewheel... which they couldn't.

""I could get a complete set off Craigslist for $120""

""yeah, but you'd have to find a 7-speed cassette, and they're rare""

(they're not.... but I don't actually have the wheels in hand, so... feck it.)

I said, ""go ahead, do the wheel.  Can you swap out the tire while the rim is off?""

""We normally charge, but I can let it go this time""

Wow.  He's telling me that he's doing me a favour by not reinstalling my old tire, but instead installing the one from MEC.

So I pay the remainder of the fees, come back in 30 mins, it's not done.

Come back in an hour... it's not done.

Come back in 2 hours, and I've got my bike.

""Hey, I installed the wheel, but your shifters are getting old.  They're stiff and need to be replaced.  Look at this""

He puts the bike up on the stand and shows me the bike shifting rough from the second lowest to lowest gear on the freewheel while on the highest gear of the crank... i.e., the most useless and most rough gear on the bike.

""Look at it stuttering as it can't quite get into gear""

I point to the adjustment screw on the derailleur.  It needs a twist here.

""Hang on""

He adjusts it, it moves perfectly.

WTF?  You just tried to sell me a complete set of shifters??

$120 later, I have a working bike with maladjusted brakes and a ""cheap"" wheel.  Ugh.  Next time I spend the money on a bench vice and a freewheel puller.  Never trusting a bike mechanic again.",20,9,4

The Doubletree behind SouthPark Mall was the closest and it seemed like a safer area than some hotel choices on Independence.

After checking in, they were even more surprised and excited to be staying there.  The hotel only has suites!  For that great price, they were given a one-bedroom suite, so it was like a small apartment for them rather than a hotel room.  They had a living room area, a mini kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.  The decor was nice and everything seemed very clean.  Plus, they were within walking distance of SouthPark Mall, so we could enjoy The Cheesecake Factory without even moving the car (parking is a bit limited in their small parking deck that's near the hotel entrance).

I've been to it about 8 times in the past year and have never been disappointed nor have my guests.  The menu and prices are pretty much typical of family oriented mex restaurants but the food is above average and pretty consistent.  The very first time we visited, soon after it opened, one of the co-owners came by and talked to us.  From what he said it's one of several restaurants owned by his family who are headquartered in TX (I think that's where he said).

One thing people need to know about ""Garcia's"" chain is that they are NOT all alike.  Some are definitely better than others.  The original Garcia's is at 35th Ave near McDowell Rd in Phx and while popular the food at the original is sub-par.  So don't let your experience at another one prevent you from trying this one.

I generally get a green burro and that's what I've gotten here.  And it's very good.  My wife usually gets a red burro and is very happy with those.  The meat is in chunks and usually there is plenty of it.  The gravy it swims in is good.  The only knock I have about the green burro is that the green chilies in the mix, like so many mex restaurants, is a bit overcooked.  Others in our party had fajitas and thought they were  very good.

There chips are above average and they serve a decent salsa and a bean dip with the chips.  The bean dip is tasty.  The service has been good to excellent.  The other restaurant I recommend in the tempe\/mesa area is Rosita's.  There is also a Rosita's in Phx but it's different people.

Every time I stop at the MGM, I immediately make my way to Project Pie because I feel that this is the tastiest, freshest and cheapest place you can get some real food on the strip.

Food:  They make all their pizzas fresh and from scratch.  You can choose to order from their pre-set menu, but I prefer to ""build my own"" pizza.  For under $10 you can choose everything and anything they put on your pizza, which I love.  The hubby usually has them pile on all the meats and cheeses, and I prefer a lighter pizza with veggies and garlic butter.  The pizzas are made right in front of you and taste so delicious with their thin, crispy crust (I'm drooling just thinking about it.)  They also offer a good selection of meats, cheese and topping, as well as a few sauce alternatives.

Price:  Their pre-set pizza items run about $9 - $11 each, and their ""build your own"" pizzas are about $10.  Great deal for the quality of food you get.  Me and the hubby usually get a pizza each and share a soda, and for about $20 it's a steal.

Atmosphere:  This place is located in the underground shopping are of the MGM.  It's a bit out of the way, so not as much traffic as the casino area of the hotels.  I actually like this because there is always plenty of seating available and there is no smoke smell.

Staff \/ Service:  The staff here are great!  They are always friendly and great you with a smile.  They make your pizzas exactly how you want it, and they do not hesitate if you have special requests or ask for extra cheese.

So quickly looking up another dim sum place since we were only a few streets over from Spring Mountain, we found this place.

We pulled into the parking lot and it was packed. My husband dropped me off so he could find parking. This place was crazy, but of course because it was Chinese New Year. We ended up getting seated in the ""party"" room which was almost full. 

I'm just going to list what was wrong...
1. We were seated next to a door that I thought was locked, but the smokers kept going in and out of. Eventually an employee locked the door for me as I made a motion that I was cold. As one of the smokers tried to re-enter, he was startled that the door was locked. My husband gave him the look and hand motion, Go Around!
2. The table linen was soiled from the previous diners. Ugh!
3. The tea pot! Was it someone elses tea pot and they just refilled it with more tea leaves and hot water! Their was tea leaves stuck to the top of the lid. As I looked around the other tables, they had nice clean tea pots!.
4. Wait time. I know, it was Chinese New Years.

And because the list of things above made me feel icky, so did the utensils and dishes. Even though they appeared and felt clean, unless I knew it was fresh and hot out of the wash, it was still icky for me.

Our server did apologize for the wait and thanked us for our patience.

We ordered house pan fried noodles, honey walnut shrimp, sweet sour pork, and opted for house fried rice instead of white rice. At least the food was good.  Unfortunately, we didn't get the dim sum we was hoping for.

The food I ordered was supposed to be beef and noodles and was on the specials. However, what I got was canned cafeteria grade over cooked gooey noodles and what amounted to canned dog food grade beef & gravy. I found a LONG curly hair in my gravy. 

My wife had the salad bar and it had gross browning lettuce, the cheap kind. Tomatoes were soggy. No variety. Not worth the cost. 

The waitress was nice and extremely helpful and actually apologized for my food, saying the cook had a bad day.

We have always encountered friendly service and excellent food. In the beginning there were a few inconsistencies in the service, but that's forgivable since the food is so great and they are a new restaurant.

Mia Francesca changes their menu regularly, that's the reason it's hand written. Even with a one page menu they offer a wide variety of selections. Typically you will find:

A wide variety of salads and appetizers
Several Pizza choices
Six Pasta dishes
Six Entrees 
A GREAT dessert menu
a nice wine list

The main restaurant isn't open, but the lounge hosts The Burger Bar from 11:30 to 2:30 PM. 

The menu is small. There are a few appetizers - guacamole (not the best in town) and a Cabo style shrimp cocktail ($6.95) which I've heard is quite good. A few salads - chicken  
Caesar and Mediterranean with chicken, both $8.95. They looked tasty and were quite large. And a few uninspiring sounding sandwiches.

The real reason to come here is the burgers; big, juicy and cooked to order (even if the menu says differently). The basic burger is $7.95, and nine variations are listed (all $8.95), but you can create your own for the same price. Slaw is served alongside. But, get this, for $1.95 you can get a huge plate of delicious onion ""strings"". I don't know why they're called strings, which are often dry and overcooked. These are basically onion rings which have been cut open so they're not round (again, I have no idea why). Fries are the same price, or you can have half and half.

The other reason to go to The Burger Bar is the broasted chicken. This is half a chicken  deep-fried in a pressure cooker. According to the explanation on the menu, ""pressure frying seals in the flavors and seals out the oil"". Ken will attest to this. The chicken was nice and crispy, not greasy and not salty. And the price was right - $9.95 for a serving size that runs at least $16 almost anywhere else. A word of caution. The chicken isn't pre-cooked (thank heavens) so it takes 20 minutes to a half hour to reach your table.

There's a mini creme brulee ($1.95) for dessert. This lone little offering struck me as very funny. 

While you're waiting for your chicken you can walk around and look for artifacts from you favorite team. It's a fun place and a most reasonable price for lunch.",1,1,2

Dakao is busy - I order the BBQ pork banh Mi ( $3.25) - slight increase in price since my last visit.  Sammie is prepared quickly, out the door I go quickly to hit Roma across street.  I did notice the sammie looked somewhat smaller than the last time I was there

Half time of first game, time to nosh - yes, the sandwiches have definitely shrunk but still a decent amount of filling - perfect ratio of veggies and meat.  Overall, a tasty sammie !

Although the lack of decent fast food joints has been slowly improving in the last few years, West Rouge still leaves much to be desired when it comes to variety.  

Enter another Mucho Burrito location at the corner of Kingston and Rylander (just west of Port Union Rd).  Hubby and I visited the resto over the Thanksgiving long weekend for a quick meal before running our errands.  We were armed with coupons (otherwise I would not have gone there :p) for ""buy 1 burrito and get the 2nd burrito equal or lesser value for free"", we ordered 1 medio barbacoa (pulled beef) burrito with pico de gallo (your average salsa) smothered, 1 medio carne asada (marinaded steak) with pico de gallo and guacamole and a bottle of mango Jarrito (carbonated beverage).  The bill came to little over $12 for the whole meal so it was a great start.  

Let me just say, I think they could probably use less people on the burrito assembly line as there were 6-7 people, each adding 1 or 2 ingredients before passing the burrito down to the next eagerly waiting staff.  Anyways....

My hubby's smothered barbacoa burrito came covered in a surprisingly pleasant chipotle tomato based sauce with black bean and corn kernels.  They skimped on the sour cream topping but all in all, the burrito was a lot tastier than I had expected.  Unlike traditional burritos where they use refried beans, they had used cooked pinto beans.  Other toppings included, mexican (or not so mexican) rice, cooked veggies (stir-fried sweet peppers & onions), cheese...etc.  

My carne asada with guac was equally decent although I prefer my guacamole chunkier.  There is something very off-putting about smooth and pasty guacamole.  :p  My burrito was filled with pretty much the same fillings with the exception of pinto beans.  I had asked for black bean which were supposed to be a little spicier. 

The most surprising part of the meal was their hot sauces.  I'm no pushover when it comes to spicy food but their mega hot was actually spicy!  This definitely earned them an extra star from me.  

The one negative point was the uneven distribution of the fillings in our burritos.  The staff could take a little more care to distribute the fillings more evenly so every bite has a little bit of everything.  

My first visit to Mucho Burrito was a pleasantly surprisingly one and I look forward to returning again next time I'm in the mood for something quick.",3,0,0

The setting was very intimate, a cozy evening cocktail party in a beautifully lit cafe. I knew that our guests would have trouble taking nice photos since the lighting was not ideal, and photos using flash never turn out great, so I was extremely impressed when Robert Bava from Photo.280dg showed up with his amazing camera and captured the whole night for us without missing a beat. 

From small details like food and decor to photo-journalist type shots of our guests mingling, laughing and meeting and greeting each other, he caught it all. He set up adorable shots of my husband and me and moved amongst our guest without causing any disruption. 

My husband and I found their prices to be very competitive, especially in Toronto. Overall, Photo.280dg conducted themselves very professionally and we received our wedding photos much faster than many of my friends who had recently been married. 

As a small business owner myself, I love sharing great resources and finds with others. Photo.280dg is just that - a wonderful business to work with.

The staff was very pleasant and the service good. That is where our positive experience ended. The spartan restaurant was completely empty at prime dinner time when we went, and no one else came in while we ate.

The ""Best Gyro in the State"" was perhaps the greasiest and least appealing I've ever had (regardless of geography). The meat was definitely frozen and the oversized and thin pita got soggy and fell apart before the first bite.

The burger did *not* seem to be ""fresh, locally sourced, grass fed"" and definitely did not have any seasoning whatsoever. Bland meat, bland toppings, bland cheese, bland bun. A ""professionally trained chef"" would season the meat and would not cook it to the point of dried out chewiness. They also might toast the bun.

The fries (both potato and sweet potato) were similarly unseasoned and flavorless. Undercooked and mushy, grease soaked into the ubiquitous gingham paper used for plating.

The house-made sauces might have been good, but we couldn't tell because there was barely any to speak of on the sandwiches.

Overall: Fast and friendly service, but quite expensive, bland, greasy, and we will not be returning.

Located in Boca Park and representing one of the best artisan coffee shops in a city where such places are only now beginning to emerge Sambalatte was self-selected as an ideal meeting place with my Real Estate Agent early Friday morning, a substantial departure from his suggestion of the Starbucks just down the street but one that has since 'changed his whole approach' to coffee (and given me a great place to relax, drink good coffee, and enjoy the free wi-fi.)  Featuring a large, open floor plan with both patio seating and a loft filled with books, lounge chairs, and a communal table plus an impressive selection of scratch pastries and house-roasted coffees predominantly hailing from Central and South America ordering decisions were placed squarely in my hands, the subsequent 90 minutes covering a good variety of cakes, cookies, scones, muffins, and Viennoiserie plus the shop's oft raved Nutella latte which is every bit as good as the rumors.  Speaking to the quality of the pastry much of what we tasted at Sambalatte was well made save for an almond croissant literally oozing with frangipane and a caramel macaron that had clearly been refrigerated, but taking into account the price none were truly 'rave worthy' save for the blueberry riddled scone and complex Craquant de Cuba which managed a delicate balance of decadent and dainty; each layer presenting something new and the sum far greater than sum of its parts.",1,0,2

This year was no exception. We hadn't been in a while so didn't know a) they take reservations and b) they had expanded. 

We knew being Mother's Day it would likely be very busy. As expected we walked into a very crowded restaurant. The hostess let us know it would be about 45 mins so we decided to grab a few drinks at the counter. We ordered three different coffee drinks (I forget what they were called but they were very good). Within 10 min of being there they had a table outside for us. We were pleasantly surprised!

They had a specific menu for Mother's Day so we split the mesquite pancakes (huge portions but honestly wasn't my favorite), tacos and burrito (both of those were delicious). Portions are always way bigger than we remember (definitely could have just ordered two meals for the three of us).

So Eddie's is where I ended up, and oh em gee (insert girlish squeal), it was amazing. Manchurian fish, Chili chicken (dry), shrimp pakora, and fried rice.

The service was pretty stellar in that every waiter\/waitress in the joint checked up on us, rather than one specific person, although the guy who brought us our food was a bit of a douche. They all move pretty fast too, so it's important to speak up, and speak fast or they'll be gone before you realize it. Eddie can be seen walking around schmoozing with the patrons, which I think is a nice personal touch. The place was absolutely packed, and we had to wait a little while to get our seats, but after trying the food I can see why it would be so busy. 

I think what really sold me on this place was that after we finished eating, I took the leftovers back to my hotel and ate it for breakfast the next day (that's right, breakfast) and it was still absolutely delicious. You know you have something special when leftovers taste good. At that point I knew... I'm moving to Toronto just for the Hakka food. And Tim Horton's. And PIzza Pops. And Smarties.

Some words of advice given to us by the owner: Come early when they open so that you can try all the flavors behind the counter. Later in the day, they don't have all the flavors available in the counter and instead the poke is made to order.

Gus's is a perfectly adequate greasy-spoon diner that's well outside of Sun Prairie's ""downtown.""

The waitstaff are decently friendly and competent.  The menu, which includes a fun ""In the '50s..."" list of ZOMG EVERYTHING WAS SO CHEAP shockers, is huge and very unhealthy.  I greatly dislike the processed taste of the creamy soups, but the sandwiches, omelets and burgers are all tasty and beyond filling.  Avoid the chicken tenders -- a friend ate them once and they were inedibly salty.  The same friend pronounced the coleslaw ""meh"" (I assure you, he's a connoisseur -- I myself don't touch the stuff).  No one I've ever been there with has ever sampled the desserts.  If you choose to assuage your nagging conscience with the salad bar, you'll probably be a lot more disappointed than if you'd just gone for the Denver omelet... mmm.

I got the miso (hungry) and it was not bad, just not worth $12. I also ordered the duck confit buns which were also good, just not worth $10. I topped the meal off with ice cream and it was tasty,  just not worth $5. Are you seeing a theme here? Overpriced for what you get, in my opinion. 

The highlight to the experience was the service. Everyone was super friendly, and our waitress was top-notch. She talked to me about their sake selection, and explained how sake works (for lack of a better word). She was extremely nice, and checked in often.

Ultimately, I feel neutral toward this place. I can't exactly recommend it, but also wouldn't NOT recommend it, if that makes sense.

2) Great rates. They have 3 rates-daily, weekly and monthly. I got the long term rate obviously
3) Great rooms. Being one of the ""old deluxe versions"" there is a separate living room\/kitchen area and a large bedroom area. There is a door between them and TVs in both rooms. The bed is extremely comfortable.
4) Great Kitchen. There is a 4 burner stove, large oven, full fridge, large sink, eating supplies (plates, silverware, pots), microwave,sink and counter space. Much better that what other hotels call a kitchen (microwave and small fridge)
5) Great area. Across the street are several chain restaurants if you do not want to use the kitchen. A mall is close. A great walking path is just up the street.

The Good:

Lamb chops - Absolutely delicious!  Well-seasoned thick cuts of perfectly cooked lamb chops.  Totally caught me by surprise how tasty they were.  I had one, then another, then another, then it dawned on me - I had to eat something else!  I may have to go through my archives and post a few more photos... or maybe I'll just keep them to myself. =)

Lamb chops - In case you missed what I wrote above.

King crab legs - Meaty, juicy, and sweet.  Served chilled or hot.

Prime rib - For a buffet, the quality was way above than I expected.

Other seafood items - Raw oysters, crawfish, stone crab legs, shrimps, and then some...  These were not the kind that you'll see at a typical Chinese buffet restaurant.

Dessert station - Impressive!  This is a buffet in itself with a lot of choices for your sweet tooth.  Did I mention they have plenty of gelati and you can have them in your donut sandwich?

Timing - If you can time it perfectly near the cut-off point, you can pay for lunch and stay for dinner.  That would mean a very early dinner \/ late lunch though.

Entire spread - Huuuuuuuge!

The Bad:

Price - $50~ per adult.  This could have pulled down my rating because we are a family of 4 and our youngest, 13 years of age, already qualifies as a paying adult.  I was thinking $200~ could have been better spent somewhere else.

Wait time - Register and get a ticket with a specified time to come back or get a text message.  The lady behind the counter told my wife that if she upgraded her Total Rewards card to platinum, we can hit the queue right away.  We still had to wait about an hour even after upgrading because of the long line of customers waiting to get in. 

Missing items - For the $$$, the steaks and lobsters should be on the menu.

Sushi - It's not even worth the rant...

Overall, it was a pleasant experience despite the long wait and the hefty price tag.  I guess that's expected since this is one of the most popular buffets in Las Vegas.",140,91,129

Although the staff to child ratio was pretty bad on busy days when there are literally like 50 kids running around. The weights are kinda annoying because there is only one machine of each and find myself having to awkwardly wait for them. The showers are so tiny there's nowhere to even put ur clothes so you can't even get dressed in private without going to the bathroom. Initially it wasn't too crowded but ever since summer ended now there's never any spots in either parking lots and it's so crowded that I am going to have to cancel my membership...The fact that it doesn't have a pool for a resort style gym makes the price not so worth it. For the amount of people they have at the gym there just isn't enough equipment to not feel so crowded. It's almost like nobody has jobs because it's completely packed during the workweek after 9am...Having to park in a completely different parking lot and walk a good distance. Im disappointed because the first few months it was never this bad.,1,0,0

They even find a way to make the potatoes crispy and light instead of weighed down in grease and oil. The food is good, and everything we've tried we have really enjoyed, but if you're looking for a breakfast place that will knock your socks off, you won't find that here. And that's perfectly fine. This place doesn't pretend to be the next best thing since....well I don't know what.... and it doesn't need to because plenty of people like this place for exactly what it is: A healthy, reliable and affordable breakfast eatery that always delivers fresh tasty food with great service. For what it lacks in an adventurous and exciting menu, it makes up for with the quality and consistency of the food that does come out of the kitchen, and that's what keeps people coming back for more.

Another great experience. I have a lot if facial skin damage from sun, alcohol, and tobacco. OTC products aren't usually strong enough to repair and prevent further damage so the consultation was very informative.

Dr. Williams mentioned that more men are considering various procedures, when in the past most men would just ignore something they weren't happy about. Gynecomastia is one of those conditions that seems prevalent these days and many men are discovering this embarrassing physical condition is easily repaired by a skilled surgeon.

After frequenting the MGM Food Court more times than I would like, my sister suggested we go by the MGM Signature.  Yes, because this is place is located at the Signature, the cafe is a bit of a walk from most things in the MGM.  However, if you are looking for something healthy and fresh, Delights is the way to go.

One of the drawbacks was that their menu is not super extensive.  They carry your typical sandwiches, skillets, pasta, and juices.  Here are a few things that I tried:

Soup of the Day (Minestrone): Coming out piping hot and seasoned well, the minestrone for me was the perfect complement to my egg sandwich.  The minestrone had a slightly sweet flavor from the stewing of the vegetables.  I enjoyed the hearty sized pieces of the beans that makes a minestrone classic.  Plus, I appreciated the fact that the noodles came out al dente telling me that they weren't serving soup with pasta that had been sitting there for hours.

Melrose Avenue:  Not super flavorful but a good solid healthy choice.  Compared to most of the other options, the Melrose has perhaps the least interesting combinations but still I enjoyed the warm scrambled egg whites paired with the creamy sliced avocado and the diced tomatoes and cooked mushrooms.  In terms of flavor, it mainly came from the salty turkey bacon which also added a nice crisp for some crunch. 

In terms of service, the staff was friendly but a little on the slow side.  I guess they are cooking the items to order so it does require some more time than your typical fast food fare.  Access to the Signature is limited from the MGM side so be careful about the hours.

Overall, I would recommend Delights especially if you are looking for a MUCH better alternative to the food court options at MGM.",5,1,3

In light of that textbook example of how NOT to do business,  I'm happy to say that Elwood's management sets a perfect example of how you SHOULD do business.

After my first, lackluster review of Elwood's, and particularly of their pork barbecue, Justin - the owner of Elwood's reached out to me. He let me know they had reworked some of their menu items, including how they hold the pork after it's cooked, so that it retains its flavor better. He offered to send me a gift certificate to try out the restaurant again. I hung onto the certificate over the holidays and my husband and I managed to get in to give Elwood's a second try last Thursday.

I ordered the pulled pork platter, along with hush puppies and macaroni and cheese. As we waited, someone came by with some cornbread for us, which I hadn't been able to try on my first visit. It's good, but a little cakey and a bit messy because it falls apart so easily.

Once our food arrived, I couldn't wait to dig into the pork. Justin wasn't lying, the pork really IS really good now. It had a nice smokey flavor to it, which was exactly what I was missing before. It was substantially improved over the pork I had the first time. My husband ordered the potato wedges and green beans along with brisket (I think, I wasn't looking over at his plate much because I was so busy with my own). We both really enjoyed our meal.

If Yelp allowed for 4.5 stars, I'd grant it to Elwood's. I enjoyed my meal and I will be back. Equally as impressive as the food improvements however, are the people who run and staff this restaurant. They are a class act.",3,0,1

Atmosphere:
swankier than expected from the outside.

There is music playing at a level that will make you raise your voice a little, but no shouting necessary. Dim lighting, dark walls setting the mood. 
Great for a date, for a few friends, but with the cramped quarters it is not a place to bring a large group [note I have not seen the back patio or back of restaurant but assume it maintains a similar space]

Service:
For us - great. Our waitress brought waters before greeting us (in my opinion a good tip when your busy, slows down chances of complaint). We order three hot teas, and she kept them coming throughout the night consistently. She knew we were clearly newcomers to the restaurant and needed to review the menu and didn't rush us and and took our orders and executed them to the T.  Our plates were cleared promptly as we ate, she didn't over bother us, but yet was never too far to ask for an extra side of mushroom gravy for the fries. This is me should be a standard of dining service - she didn't go above and beyond, but did her job and service well. Thank you girl

Food\/Drinks:
Only had water and hot tea, but they were...well water and hot tea, can you really do these wrong?
Food wise I say YES! They got it really right. Having vegan\/veggie friends and being a well-versed carnivore can make eating out together and all being able to properly enjoy meals difficult. This menu had SO many options that were veggie\/vegan friendly as well as so many options of meats dishes for me. A true rarity in my experience. Normally My sis has to choose from either the salmon, shrimp or vegetable medley mess and thats it.
I ordered the lamb burger and for $11.00 I was fearful of the norm of course. Will it taste good? Look good? most importantly be bigger than the size & thickness of a toonie?? And it was! It was fresh off the grill, surprisingly thick, well cooked and not burned, and most of all delicious!! My sis ordered I think the veggie sausage burrito and our friend a veggie burger of sorts but ALL of us thoroughly enjoyed our entrees. I'd say the biggest downfall of the meals was the fries. Plenty of them, but I love when restaurants of this standard give nice steak fries. Cannot wait to try out the Bison burger and the Le Brie burger next!

Bang for my Buck?
YES
For all 3 of us our total was $37. And we all went home full. I reccommend it, great locale, there seems to be some velvet rope club right next door and the streetcar drops off directly in front. I shall return even just for takeout.


*****
Update -
Went back last week to get some take-out. 
Ordered the Bison burger, definitely not as great as the lamb, but sill very worth the money. Only issue I had, was it a just a bit dry. The meat is leaner and I guess I just prefer that deliciously fatty lamb.
We sat (before realizing we just wanted to go home and eat) in the back patio, it was well warmed for the winter winter, plenty of tables and our waiter for 10 minutes was a sweet guy.

I showed up at 9:05 (they open at 9) and signed in with the Kiosk system (no need to wait to talk to the receptionist who seemed busy with phone calls - but was friendly and informed me of the kiosk check-in). The system let me know how many patients were ahead of me (5). Waiting room was small but bright and I sat near the door so I could see the people passing by. Called in to the room at 9:30.

Nurse got my information, sat for approximately 5 more minutes waiting for the doctor. The exam was quick and he seemed friendly and knowledgeable. 
All-in-all, done by 9:45.

Also, it's just a short trek to the Shopper's down the street to fill the prescription.

Wendy's Noodle Cafe is an Asian fusion restaurant with lots of creative dishes.  They have gone where no other Chinese restaurant has gone, at least in the Southern California area.

Tommy Bahama...the clothing company...yes...has a restaurant beside their store. It comes with good reviews. 
I agree with the service. Very good. Friendly, attentive, funny and personable. 
The ambiance is superb. It feels like you are in a tropical location. Outside seating is scarce and no reservations are allowed. Uptairs and inside they take reservations. Opt for upstairs near a window. Nice breeze on a warm night...ahhh. 
The caribbean theme is a nice touch. Fits the location well. It's definitely a wanna be upscale chainish spot inside a high end shopping center. 
The food was alright. Nothing different than other chain spots. 
Not on the menu is a 3 layered tower of apps. You're limited to what you can get but you will save money and it's enough to feed 4. We decided on: Chicken Lollipops, Coconut Crusted Crab Cakes, World Famous Coconut Shrimp (seriously, world famous?)...CL's were good and worth a try, CC are a pass next time around and CS was very good. 
For entrees we split 3 sandwiches: 
Cuban Sandwich - a major miss...no one at table enjoyed it. The bread was over toasted, the pork was blah and it seemed like it was missing something, oh that's right, Flavor! 
Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich - was a hit. Everyone enjoyed it. Chicken had great spices and the jerk sauce added great flavor. 
House Roasted Pork Sandwich - 2 out of 3 of us liked it. Truth be told I didn't try it because I was stuffed but otherwise it looked good. 
Dessert - we all passed but definitely opt to take a look at them. They all look good and the cheesy presentation is worth it. :-) 
Drinks - not very potent and pricey. Just go for beer or wine. 
Enjoy!",2,1,2

Not willing to say it's the best poutine in Montreal but its very good. Many poutine options to pick from but I went with the classic. Two sizes but the regular is big enough for most. Fries are on the greasier side with dark gravy and lot's of big cheese curds.

A true poutine connoisseur knows the cheese curds should be at least partially melted if the gravy is hot enough. Unfortunately this was not the case on my visit - the gravy was luke warm at best, and the cheese curds cold.

It should be noted that they have a kick ass beer selection - La fin du Monde, Cheval Blanc and multiple selections each from Boreale, Belle Gueule and St. Ambroise.

They now ask you to pay your bill before they bring you the food. This is a little odd but I imagine they get their share of drunk folks sneaking out without paying.

PS - it's 24 hours - perfect for Montreal since the bars only close at 3am.

By Saturday morning I was in so much pain I could not even tell which of my teeth hurt.  My husband got the phone book and called around but could not find an open dental office.  We called my friend who took me to Friendly Dental.  I must confess I was a bit scared...  Not just because I'm usually terrified by the dentist but also because this place had a bit of a ""fly by night"" feeling to it.  But I was desperate (I swear giving birth was less painful than this!) so I was ready to do anything, including having all my teeth pulled.
After some wait (not much when you consider I had no appointment) I was seen by Dr. Scott Nagel.  He has a very easy going attitude that, in turn, puts you at ease.  Lots of jokes (""Don't worry, I've been doing this for 3 months"" or ""I watched a video on this procedure last night so I'm pretty sure I can do it"") which he probably has told a million times but which I really appreciated at the time and helped me relax.  I was told I needed a root canal and was surprised he could do it right on the spot (my dentist in NH would've sent me to a specialist).  I have really bad teeth and have had numerous root canals.  I have to say this was the easiest one EVER.  The whole thing took maybe 45 minutes and it was, for once, painless.  Both the Dr. and his assistant were sweet and considerate of my suffering and my obvious fear.  Now I feel like going through the 15 hour drive every time I need to go to the dentist.  Great job, Dr Nagel!
P.S: I wish I could remember the name of the restaurant in the same shopping center I went to after my root canal.  The Mac & Cheese was not that great but the Fried Cheesecake was to die for.",6,3,1

Another reviewer said that Zack inspected every dish. Well, he must have taken Easter Week off. The menu itself is somewhat limited with the entree selection, but that could be acceptable if the meals were exceptionally tasty. They were not. Boring, tasteless, unimaginative. Some of the meals weren't even hot. Yuck! A side point: The restrooms are upstairs. Very deserted. Very uncomfortable. Carpeting covered 
with pieces of trash. Bottom line: Good enough place if you want to drink yourself stupid, take in the marvelous views, and call it a night. But if you want a quality dinner that will make you wish you could come again soon, go to Blue Point. We will NOT be back to Alley Cat. What a shame.",0,0,0

Then one day after a few hours at Starbucks I got a craving for pizza and thought I'd give The Italian Pie a try. This is amazingly good pizza! The multigrain crust is fantastic and I LOVE that they salt and pepper the rim. The spinach and artichoke and garlic shrimp pies are my favorite, but my husband has tried several others and loved each one. 

Look, I'm not saying Brixx is bad, but it's an entirely different type of pizza. The Italian Pie is classic American pizza with a twist. That twist being interesting topping combinations and crust. The staff is super friendly and tonight I met Arturo, one of the owners. Great guy and really eager to do what he can to make his guests happy. The decor isn't great, but this is not fine dining Italian, it is a casual pizza spot. Good drink specials every night I've been there and the prices overall are good. 

One last note, I've had a lot of pizza including in Italy itself and I like these pies a lot. Notice how generous they are with their toppings and the overall consistency of the product.

So now that I've justified that I know what quality is I'll explain why I gave the place 5 stars. Simply put, it was an amazing deal. 

For 34 dollars on Memorial weekend in Las Vegas...that's right 34 I got a two queen room that was clean, spacious, and far far better than what I expected. The last time I stayed in a hotel that cheap it was not a pleasant experience (crack addicts, homeless, ect.) so the bar was set pretty low. This place exceeded my expectations and then some.

The location is really good it's smack in the middle of the strip and when you've been drinking and have on high heels location is everything. Service was prompt and friendly, in fact, my only complaint is I had to go through a fricken maze to get to my room. It was literally a journey.

So if you're a college kid, like me, looking for a clean, cheap room on the strip this place should definitely be your pick. But if  you're looking for that Venetian suite experience don't set yourself up for disappointment.

We ordered both beef & chicken empanadas, the reina pepiada, and a tequeno. The place was a little busy and it took about 10 minutes to get our food, but it only felt like forever because we were so hungry!

The restaurant was nice and clean, and the staff we interacted with were all friendly. I love that you can see into the kitchen area and watch them make your food too. Definitely some place we'd return to next time we're in Vegas.",0,0,0

The place smells like dead fish and there is a giant tree full of scorpions, it wouldn't kill them just to call Terminex to get rid of them. I overall hate this restaurant i would never go there ever again.",0,0,0
